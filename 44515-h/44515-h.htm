<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>There are several translations of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n in several
languages; but there are very few people who have the
strength of mind to read any of them through. The
chaotic arrangement and frequent repetitions, and the
obscurity of the language, are sufficient to deter the most
persistent reader, whilst the nature of a part of its contents
renders the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n unfit for a woman&#8217;s eye.</p>

<p>Yet there always has been a wish to know something
about the sacred book of the Mohammadans, and it was
with the design of satisfying this wish, whilst avoiding
the weariness and the disgust which a complete perusal
of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n must produce, that Mr. Lane arranged the
&#8216;Selections&#8217; which were published in 1843. In spite of
many printer&#8217;s errors, due to the author&#8217;s absence from
England, the book was so far successful that the edition
was exhausted, and it is now very difficult to obtain
a copy. But partly owing to the obstructions to the
reading offered by an interwoven native commentary,
and partly by reason of the preference shown for the
doctrinal over the poetical passages, the book went
into scholars&#8217; hands rather than into the libraries of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg&nbsp;vi]</a></span>
the general reading public. It has proved of considerable
service to students of Arabic, who have found
it the most accurate rendering in existence of a large part
of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n; and even native Muslims of India, ignorant
of Arabic, have used Lane&#8217;s &#8216;Selections&#8217; as their Bible.</p>

<p>In this edition I have endeavoured rather to carry out
the original intention of the translator. Experience has
shown that the first plan was over-learned to commend
itself to the average reader, for whom Mr. Lane had
destined the book; in this edition I have therefore
omitted many of the notes, which will not be missed
by the reader for whom the book is intended, and for
which the Arabic scholar has only to refer to the first
edition, or to Sale&#8217;s <i>Koran</i>, whence most of them were
derived. Again, the text of the first edition was obscured
and interrupted by an interwoven commentary, which
destroyed the pleasure of the language and often made the
meaning less intelligible than before. This commentary
has been thinned. Where it added nothing to the text, it
has been erased; where it gave a curious or valuable explanation,
it has been thrown into a footnote; where it
merely supplied a necessary word to complete the sense,
that word has been left in the text distinguished by a different
type[1]. Once more, the early and wilder <i>soorahs</i>
were almost wholly omitted in the first edition, whilst
the later more dogmatic and less poetical <i>soorahs</i> were
perhaps too fully represented. I have endeavoured to
establish the balance between the two.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg&nbsp;vii]</a></span></p>

<p>In this edition the Selections are divided into two parts.
The first is Isl&aacute;m; the second, other religions as regarded
in Isl&aacute;m. In the first are grouped, under distinctive
headings, the more important utterances of Mo&#7717;ammad on
what his followers must believe and do; in the second are
his versions of the history of the patriarchs and other personages
of the Jewish and Christian writings.</p>

<p>It is only in the First Part that I have made much alteration,
either by adding fresh extracts (distinguished by a
sign), or by making a few merely verbal alterations in the
original extracts, or by the suppression or transposition of
the commentary. Any alterations that go beyond this&mdash;new
renderings, for instance&mdash;are duly recorded in the
footnotes.</p>

<p>The Second Part is almost unchanged from the first
edition. In this part the interwoven commentary is left
entire, for the traditions of the commentators about Abraham
and Moses and Christ are as curious as the traditions
of Mo&#7717;ammad, and about as credible; and the narrative
style of the Second Part allows the introduction of parentheses
more easily than the rhetorical form which many
of the extracts in the First Part present.</p>

<p>Mr. Lane&#8217;s Introduction was abridged from Sale&#8217;s Preliminary
Discourse, with but little addition from his own
knowledge. Sale&#8217;s Discourse abounds in information, but
it is too detailed and lengthy for the purpose of this
volume. I have, then, substituted a short sketch of the
beginnings of Isl&aacute;m. I have tried to bring home to the
reader the little we know of the early Arabs; then to draw
the picture of the great Arab prophet and his work; to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg&nbsp;viii]</a></span>
show what are the salient points of Isl&aacute;m; and finally
to explain something of the history of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n and its
contents. I am conscious of having drawn the picture
with a weak hand, but I hope the sketch may serve as a
not quite useless introduction to a volume of typical selections
from a book which, in the peculiar character of its
contents and the extraordinary power of its influence, has
not its parallel in the world.</p>

<p>Between Egypt and Assyria, jostled by both, yielding to
neither, lay a strange country, unknown save at its marches
even to its neighbours, dwelt-in by a people that held
itself aloof from all the earth&mdash;a people whom the great
empires of the ancient world in vain essayed to conquer,
against whom the power of Persia, Egypt, Rome, Byzantium
was proven impotence, and at whose hands even the
superb Alexander, had he lived to test his dream, might
for once have learnt the lesson of defeat. Witnessing the
struggle and fall of one and another of the great tyrannies
of antiquity, yet never entering the arena of the fight;&mdash;swept
on its northern frontier by the conflicting armies of
Khusru and C&aelig;sar, but lifting never a hand in either
cause;&mdash;Arabia was at length to issue forth from its silent
mystery, and after baffling for a thousand years the curious
gaze of strangers, was at last to draw to itself the
fearful eyes of all men. The people of whom almost
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg&nbsp;xii]</a></span>
nothing before could certainly be asserted but its existence
was finally of its own free will to throw aside the veil, to
come forth from its fastnesses, and imperiously to bring
to its feet the kingdoms of the world.</p>

<p>It is not all Arabia of which I speak. The story to
tell has nothing as yet to say to the &#8216;happy&#8217; tilled lands of
the south, nor to the outlying princedoms of El-&#7716;eereh and
Ghass&aacute;n bordering the territories and admitting the suzerainty
of Persia and Rome. These lands were not wrapped
in mystery: the Himyerite&#8217;s kingdom in the Yemen, the
rule of Zenobia at Palmyra, were familiar to the nations
around. But the cradle of Isl&aacute;m was not here.</p>

<p>Along the eastern coast of the Red Sea, sometimes
thrusting its spurs of red sandstone and porphyry into the
waves, sometimes drawing away and leaving a wide stretch
of lowland, runs a rugged range of mountain. One above
another, the hills rise from the coast, leaving here and there
between them a green valley, where you may see an Arab
settlement or a group of Bedawees watering their flocks.
Rivers there are none; and the streams that gather from
the rainfall are scarcely formed but they sink into the
parched earth. Yet beneath the dried-up torrent-beds a
rivulet trickles at times, and straightway there spreads a
rich oasis dearly prized by the wanderers of the desert.
All else is bare and desolate. Climb hill after hill, and
the same sight meets the eye&mdash;barren mountain-side, dry
gravelly plain, and the rare green valleys. At length
you have reached the topmost ridge; and you see, not
a steep descent, no expected return to the plain, but a
vast desert plateau, blank, inhospitable, to all but Arabs
unindwellable. You have climbed the &#7716;ij&aacute;z&mdash;the &#8216;barrier&#8217;&mdash;and
are come to the steppes of the Nejd&mdash;the &#8216;highland.&#8217;
In the valleys of this barrier-land are the Holy
Cities, Mekka and Medina. Here is the birthplace of
Isl&aacute;m: the Arab tribes of the &#7716;ij&aacute;z and the Nejd were
the first disciples of Mo&#7717;ammad.</p>

<p>One may tell much of a people&#8217;s character from its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg&nbsp;xiii]</a></span>
home. Truism as it seems, there is yet a meaning in the
saying that the Arabs are peculiarly the people of Arabia.
Those who have travelled in this wonderful land tell us of
the quickening influence of the air and scene of the desert.
The fresh breath of the plain, the glorious sky, the still
of the wide expanse, trod by no step but your own, looked
upon only by yourself and perhaps yonder solitary eagle
or the wild goat leaping the cliffs you have left behind,
the absolute stillness and aloneness, bring about a strange
sense of delight and exultation, a bounding-up of spirits
held in long restraint, an unknown nimbleness of wit and
limb. The Arabs felt all this and more in their bright
imaginative souls. A few would settle in villages, and
engage in the trade which came through from India
to the West; but such were held in poor repute by the
true Bedawees, who preferred above all things else the free
life of the desert. It is a relief to turn from the hurry
and unrest of modern civilisation, from the never-ending
strife for wealth, for &#8216;position,&#8217; for pleasure, even for
knowledge, and look for a moment on the careless life of
the Bedawee. He lived the aimless, satisfied life of some
child; he sought no change; he was supremely content
with the exquisite sense of simple existence; he was
happy because he lived. He wished no more. He
dreaded the dark After-death; he thrust it from his
thoughts as often as it would force itself unwelcome upon
him. Utterly fearless of man and fortune, he took no
thought for the morrow: whatever it brought forth, he
felt confidently his strength to enjoy or endure; only let
him seize the happiness of to-day while it shall last, and
drain to the dregs the overbrimming cup of his life. He
was ambitious of glory and victory, but it was not an
ambition that clouded his joy. Throughout a life that
was full of energy, of passion, of strong endeavour after
his ideal of desert perfectness, there was yet a restful sense
of satisfied enjoyment, a feeling that life was of a surety
well worth living.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg&nbsp;xiv]</a></span></p>

<p>For the Arab had his ideal of life. The true son of the
desert must in the old times do more than stretch his
limbs contentedly under the shade of the overhanging
rock. He must be brave and chivalrous, generous, hospitable;
ready to sacrifice himself and his substance for his
clan; prompt to help the needy and the traveller; true to
his word, and, not least, eloquent in his speech.</p>

<p>Devotion to the clan was the strongest tie the Arab
possessed. Though tracing their descent from a common
traditional ancestor, the great northern family of Bedawees
was split up into numerous clans, owning no
central authority, but led, scarcely governed, each by its
own chief, who was the most valiant and best-born man
in it. The whole clan acted as one being; an injury done
to one member was revenged by all, and even a crime
committed by a clansman was upheld by the whole brotherhood.
Though a small spark would easily light-up war
between even friendly clans, it was rarely that those of
kin met as enemies. It is told how a clan suffered
long and oft-repeated injuries from a kindred clan without
one deed of revenge. &#8216;They are our brothers,&#8217; they
said; &#8216;perhaps they will return to better feelings; perhaps
we shall see them again as they once were.&#8217; To be brought
to poverty or even to die for the clan, the Arab deemed
his duty&mdash;his privilege. To add by his prowess or his

<p>The renown of the clan was closely wrapped up with
the Arab chieftain&#8217;s personal renown. He was keenly
sensitive on the point of honour, and to that notion he
attached a breadth of meaning which can scarcely be
understood in these days. Honour included all the different
virtues that went to make up the ideal Bedawee.
To be proved wanting in any of these was to be dishonoured.
Above all things, the man who would &#8216;keep
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg&nbsp;xvi]</a></span>
his honour and defile it not&#8217; must be brave and hospitable&mdash;</p>

<div class="line">A rushing rain-flood when he gave guerdons:</div>
<div class="line i1">when he sprang to the onset, a mighty lion.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Arab warrior was a mighty man of valour. He
would spend whole days in the saddle, burdened with heavy
armour, in the pursuit of a foe, seeking the life of the
slayer of his kin, or sweeping down upon the caravan of
rich merchandise which his more peaceful countrymen
of the towns were carrying through the deserts. The
Arab lived mainly by plunder. His land did not yield
him food&mdash;unless it were dates, the Bedawee&#8217;s bread&mdash;and
he relied on the success of his foraging expeditions for his
support. These he conducted with perfect good-breeding;
he used no violence when it could be avoided; he merely
relieved the caravan from the trouble of carrying any
further the goods that he was himself willing to take
charge of, urging, if necessary, the unfair treatment of his
forefather Ishmael as an excellent reason for pillaging the
sons of Isaac. &#8216;When a woman is the victim, no Bedouin
brigand, however rude, will be ill-mannered enough to
lay hands upon her. He begs her to take off the garment
on which he has set his heart, and he then retires to a
distance and stands with eyes averted, lest he should do
violence to her modesty.&#8217;</p>

<p>The poems of the early Arabs are full of the deeds of
their warriors, the excitement of the pitched battle, the
delight of the pursuit, the nightly raid on the camp, the
trial of skill between rival chiefs, and the other pictures
of a warrior&#8217;s triumph. Here we find little of
the generosity of war: mercy was rarely exercised and
hatred was carried to its extremest limits; quarter was
neither asked nor given; to despatch a wounded man was
no disgrace; the families of the vanquished were enslaved.
Notwithstanding his frank genial nature, the Arab was of
a dangerously quick temper, derived, he boasted, from the
flesh he lived on of the camel, the surliest and most ill-conditioned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg&nbsp;xvii]</a></span>
of beasts. If he conceived himself insulted,
he was bound to revenge himself to the full, or he would
have been deemed dishonoured for ever. And since his
fiery temper easily took offence, the history of the early
Arabs is full of the traditions of slight quarrels and their
horrible results&mdash;secret assassination and the long-lasting
blood-feud.</p>

<p>The contempt which the Arab, with a few noble exceptions,
felt for the gentler virtues is seen in these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="line">Would that I had in their stead a folk who, when they ride forth,</div>
<div class="line i1">strike swiftly and hard, on horse or on camel borne!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A point on which the temper of the Bedawee was easily
touched was his family pride. The Arab prized good blood
as much in men as in his horses and camels. In these
he saw the importance of breed, and in men he firmly believed
the same principle held good. With the tenacious
memory of his race, he had no difficulty in remembering
the whole of a complicated pedigree, and he would
often proudly dwell on the purity of his blood and the
gallant deeds of his forefathers. He would challenge
another chief to prove a more noble descent, and hot
disputes and bitter rivalries often came of these comparisons.</p>

<p>But if noble birth brought rivalry and hatred, it
brought withal excellent virtues. The Arab nobleman
was not a man who was richer and more idle and luxurious
than his inferiors: his position, founded upon descent,
depended for its maintenance on personal qualities. Rank
brought with it onerous obligations. The chief, if he
would retain and carry on the repute of his line, must not
only be fearless and ready to fight all the world; he must
be given to hospitality, generous to kith and kin, and
to all who cry unto him. His tent must be so pitched
in the camp that it shall not only be the first that the
enemy attacks, but also the first the wayworn stranger
approaches; and at night fires must be kindled hard by to
guide wanderers in the desert to his hospitable entertain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg&nbsp;xix]</a></span>ment.
If a man came to an Arab noble&#8217;s tent and said, &#8216;I
throw myself on your honour,&#8217; he was safe from his enemies
until they had trampled on the dead body of his host.
Nothing was baser than to give up a guest; the treachery
was rare, and brought endless dishonour upon the clan in
which the shame had taken place. The poet extols the
tents&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">Where dwells a kin great of heart, whose word is enough to shield</div>
<div class="line i1">whom they shelter when peril comes in a night of fierce strife and storm;</div>
<div class="line">Yea, noble are they: the seeker of vengeance gains not from them</div>
<div class="line i1">the blood of his foe, nor is he that wrongs them left without help.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The feeling lasted even under the debased rule of
Muslim despots; for it is related that a governor was once
ordering-out some prisoners to execution, when one of
them asked for a drink of water, which was immediately
given him. He then turned to the governor and said,
&#8216;Wilt thou slay thy guest?&#8217; and was forthwith set free.
A pledge of protection was inferred in the giving of hospitality,
and to break his word was a thing not to be
thought upon by an Arab. He did not care to give an
oath; his simple word was enough, for it was known to
be inviolable. Hence the priceless worth of the Arab
chief&#8217;s word of welcome: it meant protection, unswerving
fidelity, help, and succour.</p>

<p>There was no bound to this hospitality. It was the
pride of the Arab to place everything he possessed at
the service of the guest. The last milch-camel must be
killed sooner than the duties of hospitality be neglected.
The story is told of &#7716;&aacute;tim, a gallant poet-warrior of the
tribe of &#7788;ayyi, which well illustrates the Arab ideal of
hostship. &#7716;&aacute;tim was at one time brought to the brink of
starvation by the dearth of a rainless season. For a whole
day he and his family had eaten nothing, and at night, after
soothing the children to sleep by telling them some of those
stories in which the Arabs have few rivals, he was trying
by his cheerful conversation to make his wife forget her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg&nbsp;xx]</a></span>
hunger. Just then they heard steps without, and a corner
of the tent was raised. &#8216;Who is there?&#8217; said &#7716;&aacute;tim. A
woman&#8217;s voice replied, &#8216;I am such a one, thy neighbour.
My children have nothing to eat, and are howling like young
wolves, and I have come to beg help of thee.&#8217; &#8216;Bring them
here,&#8217; said &#7716;&aacute;tim. His wife asked him what he would do,
for if he could not feed his own children, how should he find
food for this woman&#8217;s? &#8216;Do not disturb thyself,&#8217; he answered.
Now &#7716;&aacute;tim had a horse renowned far and wide for
the purity of his stock and the fleetness and beauty of his
paces. He would not kill his favourite for himself nor
even for his own children; but now he went out and slew
him, and prepared him with fire for the strangers&#8217; need. And
when he saw them eating with his wife and children, he
exclaimed, &#8216;It were a shame that you alone should eat
whilst all the camp is perishing of hunger;&#8217; and he went
and called the neighbours to the meal, and in the morning
there remained of the horse nothing but his bones. But
as for himself, wrapped in his mantle, he sat apart in a
corner of the tent.</p>

<p>This &#7716;&aacute;tim is a type of the Arab nature at its noblest.
Though renowned for his courage and skill in war, he
never suffered his enmity to overcome his generosity. He
had sworn an oath never to take a man&#8217;s life, and he
strictly observed it, and always withheld the fatal last blow.
In spite of his clemency, he was ever successful in the
wars of his clan, and brought back from his raids many a
rich spoil, only to spend it at once in his princely fashion.
His generosity and faithful observance of his word at
times placed him in positions of great danger; but the
alternative of denying his principles seems never to have
occurred to his mind. For instance, he had imposed upon
himself as a law never to refuse a gift to him that asked it
of him. Once, engaged in single combat, he had disarmed
and routed his opponent, who then turned and said, &#8216;&#7716;&aacute;tim,
give me thy spear.&#8217; At once he threw it to him, leaving
himself defenceless; and had he not met an adversary
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg&nbsp;xxi]</a></span>
worthy of himself, this had been the last of his deeds.
Happily &#7716;&aacute;tim was not the only generous warrior of the
Arabs, and his foe did not avail himself of his advantage.
When &#7716;&aacute;tim&#8217;s friends remonstrated with him on the rashness
of an act which, in the spirit of shopkeepers, they
regarded as quixotic, &#7716;&aacute;tim said, &#8216;What would you have
me to do? He asked of me a gift!&#8217;</p>

<p>It was &#7716;&aacute;tim&#8217;s practice to buy the liberty of all captives
who sought his aid: it was but another application of the
Arab virtue of hospitality. Once a captive called to him
when he was on a journey and had not with him the
means of paying the ransom. But he was not wont to
allow any difficulties to baulk him of the exercise of his
duty, and he had the prisoner released, stepping meanwhile
into his chains until his own clan should send the
ransom.</p>

<p>Brave, chivalrous, faithful, and generous beyond the
needful of Arab ideal&mdash;so that his niggard wife, using the
privilege of high dames, repudiated him because he was
ever ruining himself and her by his open hand&mdash;&#7716;&aacute;tim
filled up the measure of Arab virtue by his eloquence,
and such of his poems as have come down to us reflect
the nobility of his life. As a youth he had shown a
strong passion for poetry, and would spare no means of
doing honour to poets. His grandfather, in despair at the
boy&#8217;s extravagance, sent him away from the camp to guard
the camels, which were pastured at a distance. Sitting there
in a state of solitude little congenial to his nature, &#7716;&aacute;tim
lifted his eyes and saw a caravan approaching. It was the
caravan of three great poets who were travelling to the
court of the King of El-&#7716;eereh. &#7716;&aacute;tim begged them to alight
and to accept of refreshment after the hot and dreary journey.
He killed them a camel each, though one would have more
than sufficed for the three; and in return they wrote him
verses in praise of himself and his kindred. Overjoyed at
the honour, &#7716;&aacute;tim insisted on the poets each accepting a
hundred camels; and they departed with their gifts. When
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg&nbsp;xxii]</a></span>
the grandfather came to the pasturing and asked where
the camels were gone, &#7716;&aacute;tim answered, &#8216;I have exchanged
them for a crown of honour, which will shine for all time
on the brow of thy race. The lines in which great poets
have celebrated our house will pass from mouth to mouth,
and will carry our glory over all Arabia.&#8217; <a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>This story well illustrates the Arab&#8217;s passionate love
of poetry. He conceived his language to be the finest
in the world, and he prized eloquence and poetry as the
goodliest gifts of the gods. There were three great events
in Arab life, when the clan was called together and great
feastings and rejoicings ensued. One was the birth of a
son to a chief; another the foaling of a generous mare;
the third was the discovery that a great poet had risen
up among them. The advent of the poet meant the immortality
of the deeds of the clansmen and the everlasting
contumely of their foes; it meant the raising up of the
glory of the tribe over all the clans of Arabia, and the
winning of triumphs by bitterer weapons than sword and
spear&mdash;the weapons of stinging satire and scurrilous squib.
No man might dare withstand the power of the poets
among a people who were keenly alive to the point of an
epigram, and who never forgot an ill-natured jibe if it
were borne upon musical verse. Most of the great heroes
of the desert were poets as well as warriors, and their
poesy was deemed the chiefest gem in their crown, and,
like their courage, was counted a proof of generous birth.
The Khalif &acute;Omar said well, &#8216;The kings of the Arabs are
their orators and poets, those who practise and who celebrate
all the virtues of the Bedawee.&#8217;</p>

<p>This ancient poetry of the Arabs is the reflection of the
people&#8217;s life. Far away from the trouble of the world,
barred by wild wastes from the stranger, the Bedawee
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg&nbsp;xxiii]</a></span>
lived his happy child&#8217;s life, enjoying to the uttermost the
good the gods had sent him, delighting in the face that
Nature showed him, inspired by the glorious breath of the
deserts that were his home. His poetry rings of that
desert life. It is emotional, passionate, seldom reflective.
Not the end of life, the whence and the whither, but the
actual present joy of existence, was the subject of his song.
Vivid painting of nature is the characteristic of this poetry:
it is natural, unpolished, unlaboured. The scenes of the
desert&mdash;the terrors of the nightly ride through the hill-girdled
valley where the Ghools and the Jinn have their
haunts; the gloom of the barren plain, where the wolf,
&#8216;like a ruined gamester,&#8217; roams ululating; the weariness
of the journey under the noonday sun; the stifling of the
sand-storm, the delusions of the mirage; or again, the
solace of the palm-tree&#8217;s shade, and the delights of the
cool well;&mdash;such are the pictures of the Arab poet. The
people&#8217;s life is another frequent theme: the daily doings
of the herdsman, the quiet pastoral life, on the one hand;
on the other, the deeds of the chiefs&mdash;war, plunder, the
chase, wassail, revenge, friendship, love. There were
satires on rival tribes, panegyrics on chiefs, laments for
the dead. This poetry is wholly objective, artless, childlike;
it is the outcome of a people still in the freshness of
youth, whom the mysteries and complications of life have
not yet set a-thinking. &#8216;Just as his language knows but
the present and the past, so the ancient Arab lived but in
to-day and yesterday. The future is nought to him; he
seizes the present with too thorough abandonment to have
an emotion left for anything beyond. He troubles himself
not with what fate the morrow may bring forth, he
dreams not of a beautiful future,&mdash;only he revels in the
present, and his glance looks backward alone. Rich in
ideas and impressions, he is poor in thought. He drains
hastily the foaming cup of life; he feels deeply and passionately;
but it is as if he were never conscious of the
coming of the thoughtful age which, while it surveys the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg&nbsp;xxiv]</a></span>
past, as often turns an anxious look to the unknown
future.&#8217;</p>

<p>It is very difficult for a Western mind to enter into the
real beauty of the old Arab poetry. The life it depicts is
so unlike any we can now witness, that it is almost removed
beyond the pale of our sympathies. The poetry is
loaded with metaphors and similes, which to us seem far-fetched,
though they are drawn from the simplest daily
sights of the Bedawee. Moreover, it is only in fragments
that we can read it; for the change in the whole character
of Arab life and in the current of Arab ideas which
followed the conquests of Isl&aacute;m extinguished the old
songs, which were no longer suitable to the new conditions
of things; and as they were seldom recorded
in writing, we possess but a little remnant of them.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>
Yet &#8216;these fragments may be broken, defaced, dimmed,
and obscured by fanaticism, ignorance, and neglect; but
out of them there arises anew all the freshness, bloom,
and glory of desert-song, as out of Homer&#8217;s epics rise the
glowing spring-time of humanity and the deep blue
heavens of Hellas. It is not a transcendental poetry, rich
in deep and thoughtful legend and lore, or glittering in
the many-coloured prisms of fancy, but a poetry the chief
task of which is to paint life and nature as they really
are; and within its narrow bounds it is magnificent. It
is chiefly and characteristically full of manliness, of vigour,
and of a chivalrous spirit, doubly striking when compared
with the spirit of abjectness and slavery found in some
other Asiatic nations. It is wild and vast and monotonous
as the yellow seas of its desert solitudes; it is daring and
noble, tender and true.&#8217; <a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg&nbsp;xxv]</a></span></p>

<p>There was one place where, above all others, the &#7730;a&#7779;eedehs
of the ancient Arabs were recited: this was &acute;Ok&aacute;&#7693;h, the
Olympia of Arabia, where there was held a great annual
Fair, to which not merely the merchants of Mekka and the
south, but the poet-heroes of all the land resorted. The
Fair of &acute;Ok&aacute;&#7693;h was held during the sacred months,&mdash;a sort
of &#8216;God&#8217;s Truce,&#8217; when blood could not be shed without a
violation of the ancient customs and faiths of the Bedawees.
Thither went the poets of rival clans, who had as
often locked spears as hurled rhythmical curses. There
was little fear of a bloody ending to the poetic contest, for
those heroes who might meet there with enemies or blood-avengers
are said to have worn masks or veils, and their
poems were recited by a public orator at their dictation.
That these precautions and the sacredness of the time could
not always prevent the ill-feeling evoked by the pointed
personalities of rival singers leading to a fray and bloodshed
is proved by recorded instances; but such results
were uncommon, and as a rule the customs of the time
and place were respected. In spite of occasional broils
on the spot, and the lasting feuds which these poetic
contests must have excited, the Fair of &acute;Ok&aacute;&#7693;h was a
grand institution. It served as a focus for the literature
of all Arabia: every one with any pretensions to poetic
power came, and if he could not himself gain the applause
of the assembled people, at least he could form one of the
critical audience on whose verdict rested the fame or the
shame of every poet. The Fair of &acute;Ok&aacute;&#7693;h was a literary
congress, without formal judges, but with unbounded
influence. It was here that the polished heroes of the
desert determined points of grammar and prosody; here
the seven Golden Songs were recited, although (alas for
the charming legend!) they were <i>not</i> afterwards &#8216;suspended&#8217;
on the Ka&#7841;beh; and here &#8216;a magical language, the language
of the &#7716;ij&aacute;z,&#8217; was built out of the dialects of Arabia,
and was made ready to the skilful hand of Mo&#7717;ammad,
that he might conquer the world with his &#7730;ur-&aacute;n.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg&nbsp;xxvi]</a></span></p>

<p>The Fair of &acute;Ok&aacute;&#7693;h was not merely a centre of emulation
for Arab poets: it was also an annual review of Bedawee
virtues. It was there that the Arab nation once-a-year
inspected itself, so to say, and brought forth and
criticised its ideals of the noble and the beautiful in life
and in poetry. For it was in poetry that the Arab&mdash;and
for that matter each man all the world over&mdash;expressed
his highest thoughts, and it was at &acute;Ok&aacute;&#7693;h that these
thoughts were measured by the standard of the Bedawee
ideal. The Fair not only maintained the highest standard
of poetry that the Arabic language has ever reached: it
also upheld the noblest idea of life and duty that the
Arab nation has yet set forth and obeyed. &acute;Ok&aacute;&#7693;h was
the press, the stage, the pulpit, the Parliament, and the
Acad&eacute;mie Fran&ccedil;aise of the Arab people; and when, in his
fear of the infidel poets (whom Imra-el-&#7730;eys was to usher
to hell), Mo&#7717;ammad abolished the Fair, he destroyed the
Arab nation even whilst he created his own new nation of
Muslims;&mdash;and the Muslims cannot sit in the places of
the old pagan Arabs.</p>

<p>It is very difficult for the Western mind to dissociate the
idea of Oriental poetry from the notion of amatory odes, and
sonnets to the lady&#8217;s eyebrow: but even the few extracts
that have been given in this chapter show that the Arab
had many other subjects besides love to sing about, and
though the divine theme has its place in almost every poem,
it seldom rivals the prominence of war and nature-painting,
and it is treated from a much less sensual point of view
than that of later Arab poets. Many writers have drawn
a gloomy picture of the condition of women in Arabia
before the coming of Mo&#7717;ammad, and there is no doubt
that in many cases their lot was a miserable one. There
are ancient Arabic proverbs that point to the contempt in
which woman&#8217;s judgment and character were held by the
Arabs of &#8216;the Time of Ignorance,&#8217; and Mo&#7717;ammad must
have derived his mean opinion of women from a too general
impression among his countrymen. The marriage tie was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg&nbsp;xxvii]</a></span>
certainly very loose among the ancient Arabs. The ceremony
itself was of the briefest. The man said <i>khi&#7789;b</i> (<i>i.e.</i>
I am an asker-in-marriage), and the giver-away answered
<i>nik&#7717;</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, I am a giver-in-marriage), and the knot was thus
tied, only to be undone with equal facility and brevity.
The frequency of divorce among the Arabs does not speak
well for their constancy, and must have had a degrading
effect upon the women. Hence it is argued that women
were the objects of contempt rather than of respect among
the ancient Arabs.</p>

<p>Yet there is reason to believe that the evidence upon
which this conclusion is founded is partial and one-sided.
There was a wide gulf between the Bedawee and the town
Arab. It is not impossible that the view commonly entertained
as to the state of women in pre&iuml;slamic times is
based mainly on what Mo&#7717;ammad saw around him in
Mekka, and not on the ordinary life of the desert. To
such a conjecture a curiously uniform support is lent by
the ancient poetry of the desert; and though the poets
were then&mdash;as they always are&mdash;men of finer mould than
the rest, yet their example, and still more their poems
passing from mouth to mouth, must have created a widespread
belief in their principles. It is certain that the
roaming Bedawee, like the medi&aelig;val knight, entertained
a chivalrous reverence for women, although he, too, like
the knight, was not always above a career of promiscuous
gallantry; but there was always a certain glamour of
romance about the intrigues of the Bedawee. He did not
regard the object of his love as a chattel to be possessed,
but as a divinity to be assiduously worshipped. The poems
are full of instances of the courtly respect displayed by
the heroes of the desert toward defenceless maidens, and
the mere existence of so general an ideal of conduct in the
poems is a strong argument for Arab chivalry: for with
the Arabs the abyss between the ideal accepted of the
mind and the attaining thereof in action was narrower
than it is among &#8216;more advanced&#8217; nations.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg&nbsp;xxviii]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever was the condition of women in the trading
cities and villages, it is certain that in the desert woman
was regarded as she has never since been among Muslims.
The modern &#7717;areem system was there as yet undreamt
of; the maid of the desert was unfettered by the
ruinous restrictions of modern life in the East. She was
free to choose her own husband, and to bind him to have
no other wife than herself. She might receive male
visitors, even strangers, without suspicion: for her virtue
was too dear to her and too well assured to need the
keeper. It was the bitterest taunt of all to say to a
hostile clan that their men had not the heart to give
nor their women to deny; for the chastity of the women
of the clan was reckoned only next to the valour
and generosity of the men. In those days bastardy was
an indelible stain. It was the wife who inspired the
hero to deeds of glory, and it was her praise that he most
valued when he returned triumphant. The hero of desert
song thought himself happy to die in guarding some women
from their pursuers. Wounded to the death, &acute;Antarah
halted alone in a narrow pass, and bade the women press
on to a place of safety. Planting his spear in the ground,
he supported himself on his horse, so that when the pursuers
came up they knew not he was dead, and dared not
approach within reach of his dreaded arm. At length the
horse moved, and the body fell to the ground, and the
enemies saw that it was but the corpse of the hero that
had held the pass. In death, as in a life <i>sans peur et sans
reproche</i>, &acute;Antarah was true to the chivalry of his race.</p>

<p>There are many instances like this of the knightly
courtesy of the Arab chief in &#8216;the Time of Ignorance.&#8217;
In the old days, as an ancient writer says, the true Arab
had but one love, and her he loved till death, and she him.
Even when polygamy became commoner, especially in the
towns, it was not what is meant by polygamy in a modern
Muslim state: it was rather the patriarchal system of
Abram and Sarai.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg&nbsp;xxix]</a></span></p>

<p>There is much in the fragments of the ancient poetry
which reflects this fine spirit. It is ofttimes &#8216;tender and
true,&#8217; and even Isl&aacute;m could not wholly root out the
real Arab sentiment, which reappears in Muslim times
in the poems of Aboo-Fir&aacute;s. Especially valuable is the
evidence of the old poetry with regard to the love of
a father for his daughters. Infanticide, which is commonly
attributed to the whole Arab nation of every age
before Isl&aacute;m, was in reality exceedingly rare in the
desert, and after almost dying out only revived about
the time of Mo&#7717;ammad. It was probably adopted by
poor and weak clans, either from inability to support
their children, or in order to protect themselves from the
stain of having their children dishonoured by stronger
tribes, and the occasional practice of this barbarous and
suicidal custom affords no ground for assuming an unnatural
hatred and contempt for girls among the ancient
Arabs. These verses of a father to his daughter tell a
different story:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="line">If no Umeymeh were there, no want would trouble my soul,</div>
<div class="line i1">no labour call me to toil for bread through pitchiest night;</div>

of infanticide:&mdash;</p>

<p>Hitherto we have been looking at but one side of Arab
life. The Bedawees were indeed the bulk of the race, and
furnished the swords of the Muslim conquests; but there
was also a vigorous town-life in Arabia, and the citizens
waxed rich with the gains of their trafficking. For through
Arabia ran the trade-route between East and West: it was
the Arab traders who carried the produce of the Yemen to
the markets of Syria; and how ancient was their commerce
one may divine from the words of a poet of Jud&aelig;a
spoken more than a thousand years before the coming of
Mo&#7717;ammad.</p>

<div class="poetry-container" style="margin-left: 2em;">

</div></div></div>

<p>Mekka was the centre of this trading life, the typical
Arab city of old times&mdash;a stirring little town, with its
caravans bringing the silks and woven stuffs of Syria and
the far-famed damask, and carrying away the sweet-smelling
produce of Arabia, frankincense, cinnamon, sandal-wood,
aloe, and myrrh, and the dates and leather
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg&nbsp;xxxi]</a></span>
and metals of the south, and the goods that come to
the Yemen from Africa and even India; its assemblies
of merchant-princes in the Council Hall near the
Ka&#7841;beh; and again its young poets running over with
love and gallantry; its Greek and Persian slave-girls
brightening the luxurious banquet with their native songs,
when as yet there was no Arab school of music, and the
monotonous but not unmelodious chant of the camel-driver
was the national song of Arabia; and its club, where
busy men spent their idle hours in playing chess and
draughts, or in gossiping with their acquaintance. It
was a little republic of commerce, too much infected with
the luxuries and refinements of the states it traded with,
yet retaining enough of the free Arab nature to redeem it
from the charge of effeminacy.</p>

<p>Mekka was a great home of music and poetry, and
this characteristic lasted into Muslim times. There
is a story of a certain stonemason who had a wonderful
gift of singing. When he was at work the young
men used to come and importune him, and bring him
gifts of money and food to induce him to sing. He
would then make a stipulation that they should first help
him in his work; and forthwith they would strip off their
cloaks, and the stones would gather round him rapidly.
Then he would mount a rock and begin to sing, whilst the
whole hill was coloured red and yellow with the variegated
garments of his audience. Singers were then held in the
highest admiration, and the greatest chiefs used to pay
their court to ladies of the musical profession. One of
them used to give receptions, open to the whole city, in
which she would appear in great state, surrounded by her
ladies-in-waiting, each dressed magnificently, and wearing
&#8216;an elegant artificial chignon.&#8217; It was in this town-life that
the worse qualities of the Arab came out; it was here that
his raging passion for dicing and his thirst for wine were
most prominent. In the desert there was little opportunity
for indulging in either luxury; but in a town which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg&nbsp;xxxii]</a></span>
often welcomed a caravan bringing goods to the value of
twenty thousand pound, such excesses were to be looked
for. Excited by the song of the Greek slave-girl and the
fumes of mellow wine, the Mekkan would throw the dice
till, like the Germans of Tacitus, he had staked and lost
his own liberty.</p>

<p>But Mekka was more than a centre of trade and of
song. It was the focus of the religion of the Arabs.
Thither the tribes went up every year to kiss the black
stone which had fallen from heaven in the primeval
days of Adam, and to make the seven circuits of the
Ka&#7841;beh naked,&mdash;for they would not approach God in the
garments in which they had done their sins,&mdash;and to perform
the other ceremonies of the pilgrimage. The Ka&#7841;beh,
a cubical building in the centre of Mekka, was the most
sacred temple in all Arabia, and it gave its sanctity to all
the district around. It had been, saith tradition, first
built by Adam from a heavenly model, and then rebuilt
from time to time by Seth and Abraham and Ishmael, and
less reverend persons, and it contained the sacred things of
the land. Here was the black stone, here the great god of
red agate, Hubal, and the three hundred and sixty idols,
one for each day of the year, which Mo&#7717;ammad afterwards
destroyed in one day. Here was Abraham&#8217;s stone
and that other which marked the tomb of Ishmael, and hard
by Zemzem, the god-sent spring which gushed from the
sand when the forefather of the Arabs was perishing of
thirst.</p>

<p>The religion of the ancient Arabs, little as we know of
it, is especially interesting, inasmuch as the Arabs longest
retained the original Semitic character, and hence probably
the original Semitic religion: and so in the ancient religion
of Arabia we see the religion once professed by
Chaldeans, Canaanites, Ph&oelig;nicians. This ancient religion
&#8216;rises little higher than animistic polydaemonism. It is a
collection of tribal religions standing side by side, only
loosely united, though there are traces of a once closer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg&nbsp;xxxiii]</a></span>
connection.&#8217; <a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> The great objects of worship were the sun
and the stars and the three moon-goddesses&mdash;El-L&aacute;t the
bright moon, Men&aacute;h the dark, and El-&acute;Uzz&agrave; the union of
the two; whilst a lower cultus of trees, stones, and mountains,
supposed to be dwelt-in by souls, shows that the
religion had not yet quite risen above simple fetishism. At
the time of Mo&#7717;ammad the Arabs worshipped numerous
images, which may have been merely a development from
the previous stone-worship, or may have been introduced
from intercourse with Christians. There are traces of a
belief in a supreme God behind this pantheon, and the
moon-goddesses and other divinities were regarded as
daughters of <i>the most high God</i> (All&aacute;h ta&acute;&aacute;la)&mdash;a conception
also possibly derived from Christianity. The various
deities (but not the Supreme Allah) had their fanes, where
human sacrifices, though rare, were not unknown; and
their cultus was superintended by a hereditary line of
seers, who were held in great reverence, but never developed
into a priestly caste.</p>

<p>Besides the tribal gods, individual households had their
special Penates, to whom was due the first and the last
sal&aacute;m of the returning or outgoing host. But in spite of
all this superstitious apparatus the Arabs were never a
religious people. In the old days, as now, they were reckless,
skeptical, materialistic. They had their gods and
their divining-arrows, but they were ready to demolish
both if the responses proved contrary to their wishes. A
great majority believed in no future life nor in a reckoning-day
of good and evil. If a few tied camels to the graves
of the dead that the corpse might ride mounted to the
judgment-seat, it must have been the exception; and if
there are some doubtful traces of the doctrine of metempsychosis,
this again must have been the creed of the very
few.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg&nbsp;xxxiv]</a></span></p>

<p>Christianity and Judaism had made but small impress
upon the Arabs. There were Jewish tribes in the north,
and there is evidence in the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n and elsewhere that the
traditions and rites of Judaism were widely known in
Arabia. But the creed was too narrow and too exclusively
national to commend itself to the majority of the
people. Christianity fared even worse. Whether or not
St. Paul went there, it is at least certain that very little
effect was produced by the preaching of Christianity in
Arabia. We hear of Christians on the borders, and even
two or three among the Mekkans, and bishops and churches
are spoken of at Dhaf&aacute;r and Nejr&aacute;n. But the Christianity
that the Arabs knew was, like the Judaism of the northern
tribes, a very imperfect reflection of the faith it professed
to set forth. It had become a thing of the head instead
of the heart, and the refinements of monophysite and
monothelite doctrines gained no hold upon the Arab
mind.</p>

<p>Thus Judaism and Christianity, though they were well
known, and furnished many ideas and ceremonies to
Isl&aacute;m, were never able to effect any general settlement in
Arabia. The common Arabs did not care much about any
religion, and the finer spirits found the wrangling dogmatism
of the Christian and the narrow isolation of the Jew
little to their mind. For there were before the time of
Mo&#7717;ammad men who were dissatisfied with the low
fetishism in which their countrymen were plunged, and
who protested emphatically against the idle and often cruel
superstitions of the Arabs. Not to refer to the prophets,
who, as the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n relates, were sent in old time to the tribes
of &acute;&Aacute;d and Thamood to convert them, there was, immediately
before the preaching of Mo&#7717;ammad, a general feeling
that a change was at hand; a prophet was expected, and
women were anxiously hoping for male children if so be
they might mother the Apostle of God; and the more
thoughtful minds, tinged with traditions of Judaism, were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg&nbsp;xxxv]</a></span>
seeking for what they called &#8216;the religion of Abraham.&#8217;
These men were called <i>&#8216;&#7716;aneefs,&#8217;</i> or skeptics, and their
religion seems to have consisted chiefly in a negative position,
in denying the superstition of the Arabs, and in only
asserting the existence of one sole-ruling God whose absolute
slaves are all mankind, without being able to decide
on any minor doctrines, or to determine in what manner
this one God was to be worshipped. So long as the &#7716;aneefs
could give their countrymen no more definite creed than
this, their influence was limited to a few inquiring and
doubting minds. It was reserved for Mo&#7717;ammad to formulate
the faith of the &#7716;aneefs in the dogmas of Isl&aacute;m.
For the leader of these few &#8216;skeptics&#8217; was Zeyd ibn &acute;Amr,
to whom Mo&#7717;ammad often resorted, and another, Wara&#7731;ah,
was the cousin of the Prophet and his near neighbour: and
thus the &#7716;aneefs were the forerunners of the man who
was to change the destinies of the Arabs.</p>

<p>We can no longer see the true Arab as he was in &#8216;the
Time of Ignorance,&#8217; and we cannot but regret our loss;
for the Pagan Arab is a noble type of man, though
there be nobler. There is much that is admirable in
his high mettle, his fine sense of honour, his knightliness,
his &#8216;open-handed, both-handed,&#8217; generosity, his
frank friendship, and his manly independent spirit;
and the faults of this wild reckless nature are not
to be weighed against its many excellencies. When
Mo&#7717;ammad turned abroad the current of Arab life, he
changed the character of the people. The mixture with
foreign nations, and the quiet town-life that succeeded to
the tumult of conquest, gradually effaced many of the
leading ideas of the old Arab nature, and the remnant that
still dwell in the land of their fathers have lost much of
that nobleness of character which in their ancestors covered
a multitude of sins. Mo&#7717;ammad in part destroyed the
Arab and created the Muslim. The last is no amends for
the first. The modern Bedawee is neither the one nor the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg&nbsp;xxxvi]</a></span>
other; he has lost the greatness of the old type without
gaining that of the new. As far as the Arabs alone are
concerned, Mo&#7717;ammad effected a temporary good and a
lasting harm. As to the world at large, that is matter for
another chapter.</p>

<h3>II.&mdash;<i>MO&#7716;AMMAD.</i></h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">For every fiery prophet in old times,</div>
<div class="line">And all the sacred madness of the bard,</div>
<div class="line">When God made music through them, could but speak</div>
<div class="line">His music by the framework and the chord;</div>
<div class="line">And as <i>he</i> saw it <i>he hath</i> spoken truth.</div>
<div class="right">&mdash;<i>The Holy Grail.</i></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A prophet for the Arabs must fulfil two conditions if
he will bring with his good tidings the power of making
them accepted: he must spring from the traditional centre
of Arabian religion, and he must come of a noble family
of pure Arab blood. Mo&#7717;ammad fulfilled both. His
family was that branch of the &#7730;ureysh which had raised
Mekka to the dignity of the undisputed metropolis of
Arabia, and which, though impoverished, still held
the chief offices of the sacred territory. Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s
grandfather was the virtual chief of Mekka; for to him
belonged the guardianship of the Ka&#7841;beh, and he it was
who used the generous privilege of giving food and
water to the pilgrims who resorted to the &#8216;House of God.&#8217;
His youngest son, after marrying a kinswoman belonging
to a branch of the &#7730;ureysh, settled at Yethrib (Medina),
died before the birth of his son (571), and this son,
Mo&#7717;ammad, lost his mother when he was only six years
old. The orphan was adopted by his grandfather, &acute;Abd-el-Mu&#7789;&#7789;alib;
and a tender affection sprang up between
the chief of eighty years and his little grandson.
Many a day the old man might be seen sitting at his
wonted place near the Ka&#7841;beh, and sharing his mat
with his favourite. He lived but two years more; and
at his dying request, his son Aboo-&#7788;&aacute;lib took charge of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg&nbsp;xxxviii]</a></span>
Mo&#7717;ammad, for whom he too ever showed a love as of
father and mother.</p>

<p>Such is the bare outline of Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s childhood;
and of his youth we know about as little, though the
Arabian biographies abound in legends, of which some
may be true and most are certainly false. There are
stories of his journeyings to Syria with his uncle,
and his encounter with a mysterious monk of obscure
faith; but there is nothing to show for this tale, and
much to be brought against it. All we can say is,
that Mo&#7717;ammad probably assisted his family in the war
of the Fij&aacute;r, and that he must many a time have frequented
the annual Fair of &acute;O&#7731;&aacute;dh, hearing the songs of the desert
chiefs and the praise of Arab life, and listening to the
earnest words of the Jews and Christians and others who
came to the Fair. He was obliged at an early age to earn
his own living; for the noble family of the H&aacute;shimees, to
which he belonged, was fast losing its commanding
position, whilst another branch of the &#7730;ureysh was
succeeding to its dignities. The princely munificence of
H&aacute;shim and &acute;Abd-el-Mu&#7789;&#7789;alib was followed by the poverty
and decline of their heirs. The duty of providing the
pilgrims with food was given up by the H&aacute;shimees to
the rival branch of Umeyyeh, whilst they retained only the
lighter office of serving water to the worshippers. Mo&#7717;ammad
must take his share in the labour of the family,
and he was sent to pasture the sheep of the &#7730;ureysh on
the hills and valleys round Mekka; and though the people
despised the shepherd&#8217;s calling, he himself was wont to
look back with pleasure to these early days, saying that
God called never a prophet save from among the sheep-folds.
And doubtless it was then that he developed
that reflective disposition of mind which at length
led him to seek the reform of his people, whilst in his
solitary wanderings with the sheep he gained that marvellous
eye for the beauty and wonder of the earth and
sky which resulted in the gorgeous nature-painting of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg&nbsp;xxxix]</a></span>
the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n. Yet he was glad to change this menial
work for the more lucrative and adventurous post of
camel-driver to the caravans of his wealthy kinswoman
Khadeejeh; and he seems to have taken so kindly to the
duty, which involved responsibilities, and to have acquitted
himself so worthily, that he attracted the notice of
his employer, who straightway fell in love with him, and
presented him with her hand. The marriage was a singularly
happy one, though Mo&#7717;ammad was scarcely twenty-five
and his wife nearly forty, and it brought him that repose
and exemption from daily toil which he needed in order
to prepare his mind for his great work. But beyond
that, it gave him a loving woman&#8217;s heart, that was the
first to believe in his mission, that was ever ready to console
him in his despair and to keep alive within him the
thin flickering flame of hope when no man believed in
him&mdash;not even himself&mdash;and the world was black before
his eyes.</p>

<p>We know very little of the next fifteen years. Khadeejeh
bore him sons and daughters, but only the daughters
lived. We hear of his joining a league for the protection
of the weak and oppressed, and there is a legend of his
having acted with wise tact and judgment as arbitrator in
a dispute among the great families of Mekka on the occasion
of the rebuilding of the Ka&#7841;beh. During this time,
moreover, he relieved his still impoverished uncle of the
charge of his son &acute;Alee&mdash;afterwards the Bayard of Isl&aacute;m,&mdash;and
he freed and adopted a certain captive, Zeyd; and
these two became his most devoted friends and disciples.
Such is the short but characteristic record of these fifteen
years of manhood. We know very little about what
Mo&#7717;ammad did, but we hear only one voice as to what
he was. Up to the age of forty his unpretending modest
way of life had attracted but little notice from his townspeople.
He was only known as a simple upright man,
whose life was severely pure and refined, and whose true
desert sense of honour and faith-keeping had won him
the high title of El-Emeen, &#8216;the Trusty.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg&nbsp;xl]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us see what fashion of man this was, who was about
to work a revolution among his countrymen, and change
the conditions of social life in a vast part of the world.
The picture<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> is drawn from an older man than we have yet
seen; but Mo&#7717;ammad at forty and Mo&#7717;ammad at fifty or
more were probably very little different. &#8216;He was of the
middle height, rather thin, but broad of shoulders, wide of
chest, strong of bone and muscle. His head was massive,
strongly developed. Dark hair, slightly curled, flowed in
a dense mass down almost to his shoulders. Even in
advanced age it was sprinkled by only about twenty grey
hairs&mdash;produced by the agonies of his &#8220;Revelations.&#8221; His
face was oval-shaped, slightly tawny of colour. Fine,
long, arched eyebrows were divided by a vein which
throbbed visibly in moments of passion. Great black
restless eyes shone out from under long, heavy eyelashes.
His nose was large, slightly aquiline. His teeth, upon
which he bestowed great care, were well set, dazzling
white. A full beard framed his manly face. His skin
was clear and soft, his complexion &#8220;red and white,&#8221; his
hands were as &#8220;silk and satin,&#8221; even as those of a woman.
His step was quick and elastic, yet firm, and as that of
one &#8220;who steps from a high to a low place,&#8221; In turning
his face he would also turn his full body. His whole gait
and presence were dignified and imposing. His countenance
was mild and pensive. His laugh was rarely more
than a smile....</p>

<p>&#8216;In his habits he was extremely simple, though he
bestowed great care on his person. His eating and drinking,
his dress and his furniture, retained, even when he
had reached the fulness of power, their almost primitive
nature. The only luxuries he indulged in were, besides
arms, which he highly prized, a pair of yellow boots, a
present from the Negus of Abyssinia. Perfumes, however,
he loved passionately, being most sensitive of smell.
Strong drinks he abhorred.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg&nbsp;xli]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8216;His constitution was extremely delicate. He was nervously
afraid of bodily pain; he would sob and roar under
it. Eminently unpractical in all common things of life,
he was gifted with mighty powers of imagination, elevation
of mind, delicacy and refinement of feeling. &#8220;He is
more modest than a virgin behind her curtain,&#8221; it was said
of him. He was most indulgent to his inferiors, and would
never allow his awkward little page to be scolded, whatever
he did. &#8220;Ten years,&#8221; said Anas, his servant, &#8220;was I
about the Prophet, and he never said as much as &#8216;uff&#8217; to
me.&#8221; He was very affectionate towards his family. One
of his boys died on his breast in the smoky house of the
nurse, a blacksmith&#8217;s wife. He was very fond of children.
He would stop them in the streets and pat their little
cheeks. He never struck any one in his life. The worst
expression he ever made use of in conversation was,
&#8220;What has come to him?&mdash;may his forehead be darkened
with mud!&#8221; When asked to curse some one he replied,
&#8220;I have not been sent to curse, but to be a mercy to mankind.&#8221;
&#8220;He visited the sick, followed any bier he met,
accepted the invitation of a slave to dinner, mended his
own clothes, milked his goats, and waited upon himself,&#8221;
relates summarily another tradition. He never first withdrew
his hand out of another man&#8217;s palm, and turned not
before the other had turned.... He was the most faithful
protector of those he protected, the sweetest and most
agreeable in conversation; those who saw him were suddenly
filled with reverence; those who came near him
loved him; they who described him would say, &#8220;I have
never seen his like either before or after.&#8221; He was of
great taciturnity; but when he spoke it was with emphasis
and deliberation, and no one could ever forget what he
said. He was, however, very nervous and restless withal,
often low-spirited, downcast as to heart and eyes. Yet he
would at times suddenly break through these broodings,
become gay, talkative, jocular, chiefly among his own. He
would then delight in telling little stories, fairy tales, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[Pg&nbsp;xlii]</a></span>
the like. He would romp with the children and play
with their toys.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He lived with his wives in a row of humble cottages,
separated from one another by palm-branches, cemented
together with mud. He would kindle the fire, sweep the
floor, and milk the goats himself. &acute;&Aacute;&iuml;sheh tells us that
he slept upon a leathern mat, and that he mended his
clothes, and even clouted his shoes, with his own hand.
For months together ... he did not get a sufficient meal.
The little food that he had was always shared with those
who dropped in to partake of it. Indeed, outside the Prophet&#8217;s
house was a bench or gallery, on which were always
to be found a number of the poor, who lived entirely on
his generosity, and were hence called the &#8220;people of the
bench.&#8221; His ordinary food was dates and water or barley-bread;
milk and honey were luxuries of which he was
fond, but which he rarely allowed himself. The fare of
the desert seemed most congenial to him, even when he
was sovereign of Arabia.&#8217; <a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>Mo&#7717;ammad was full forty before he felt himself called
to be an apostle to his people. If he did not actually worship
the local deities of the place, at least he made no public
protest against the fetish worship of the &#7730;ureysh. Yet
in the several phases of his life, in his contact with traders,
in his association with Zeyd and other men, he had gained
an insight into better things than idols and human sacrifices,
divining-arrows and mountains and stars. He
had heard a dim echo of some &#8216;religion of Abraham;&#8217;
he had listened to the stories of the Haggadah: he
knew a very little about Jesus of Nazareth. He seems
to have suffered long under the burden of doubt and self-distrust.
He used to wander about the hills alone, brooding
over these things; he shunned the society of men, and
&#8216;solitude became a passion to him.&#8217;</p>

<p>At length came the crisis. He was spending the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg&nbsp;xliii]</a></span>
sacred months on Mount &#7716;ir&aacute;, &#8216;a huge barren rock,
torn by cleft and hollow ravine, standing out solitary in
the full white glare of the desert sun, shadowless, flowerless,
without well or rill.&#8217; Here in a cave Mo&#7717;ammad
gave himself up to prayer and fasting. Long months or
even years of doubt had increased his nervous excitable
disposition. He had had, they say, cataleptic fits during
his childhood, and was evidently more delicately and
finely constituted than those around him. Given this
nervous nature, and the grim solitude of the hill where he
had almost lived for long weary months, blindly feeling
after some truth upon which to rest his soul, it is not difficult
to believe the tradition of the cave, that Mo&#7717;ammad
heard a voice say, &#8216;Cry!&#8217; &#8216;What shall I cry?&#8217; he answers&mdash;the
question that has been burning his heart during
all his mental struggles&mdash;</p>

<p>Mo&#7717;ammad arose trembling, and went to Khadeejeh, and
told her what he had seen; and she did her woman&#8217;s part,
and believed in him and soothed his terror, and bade him
hope for the future. Yet he could not believe in himself.
Was he not perhaps mad, possessed by a devil? Were
these voices of a truth from God? And so he went again
on his solitary wanderings, hearing strange sounds, and
thinking them at one time the testimony of Heaven,
at another the temptings of Satan or the ravings of
madness. Doubting, wondering, hoping, he had fain
put an end to a life which had become intolerable in its
changings from the heaven of hope to the hell of despair,
when again he heard the voice, &#8216;Thou art the messenger
of God, and I am Gabriel.&#8217; Conviction at length seized
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Pg&nbsp;xliv]</a></span>
hold upon him; he was indeed to bring a message of good
tidings to the Arabs, the message of God through His
angel Gabriel. He went back to Khadeejeh exhausted in
mind and body. &#8216;Wrap me, wrap me,&#8217; he said; and the
word came unto him&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container" style="padding-left: 7em;">

<p>There are those who see imposture in all this; for such
I have no answer. Nor does it matter whether in a hysterical
fit or under any physical disease soever Mo&#7717;ammad
saw these visions and heard these voices. We are not
concerned to draw the lines of demarcation between
enthusiasm and ecstasy and inspiration. It is sufficient
that Mo&#7717;ammad <i>did</i> see these things&mdash;the subjective
creations of a tormented mind. It is sufficient
that he believed them to be a message from on high, and
that for years of neglect and persecution and for years of
triumph and conquest he acted upon his belief.</p>

<p>Mo&#7717;ammad now (612) came forward as the Apostle of
the One God to the people of Arabia: he was at last well
assured that his God was of a truth <i>the</i> God, and that He
had indeed sent him with a message to his people, that
they too might turn from their idols and serve the living
God. He was in the minority of one, but he was no
longer afraid; he had learnt that self-trust which is the
condition of all true work. At first he spoke to his near
kinsmen and friends; and it is impossible to overrate the
importance of the fact that his closest relations and those
who lived under his roof were the first to believe and the
staunchest of faith. The prophet who is <i>with</i> honour
in his own home need appeal to no stronger proof of his
sincerity, and that Mo&#7717;ammad <i>was</i> &#8216;a hero to his own
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[Pg&nbsp;xlv]</a></span>
valet&#8217; is an invincible argument for his earnestness. The
motherly Khadeejeh had at once, with a woman&#8217;s instinct,
divined her husband&#8217;s heart and confirmed his fainting
hope by her firm faith in him. His dearest friends,
Zeyd and &acute;Alee, were the next converts; and though,
to his grief, he could never induce his lifelong protector,
Aboo-&#7788;&aacute;lib, to abandon the gods of his fathers,
yet the old man loved him none the less, and said, when
he heard of &acute;Alee&#8217;s conversion, &#8216;Well, my son, he will not
call thee to aught save what is good; wherefore thou art
free to cleave unto him.&#8217; A priceless aid was gained in
the accession of Aboo-Bekr, who succeeded Mo&#7717;ammad
as the first Khalif of Isl&aacute;m, and whose calm judgment and
quick sagacity, joined to a gentle and compassionate heart,
were of incalculable service to the faith. Aboo-Bekr was
one of the wealthiest merchants of Mekka, and exercised no
small influence among his fellow-citizens, no less by his
character than his position. Like Mo&#7717;ammad, he had
a nickname, E&#7779;-&#7778;iddee&#7731;, &#8216;The True:&#8217; <i>The True</i> and <i>The
Trusty</i>,&mdash;no mean augury for the future of the religion!</p>

<p>Five converts followed in Aboo-Bekr&#8217;s steps; among&#7778;
them &acute;Othm&aacute;n, the third Khalif, and &#7788;al&#7717;ah, the man of
war. The ranks of the faithful were swelled from humbler
sources. There were many negro slaves in Mekka, and of
them not a few had been predisposed by earlier teaching
to join in the worship of the One God; and of those who
were first converted was the Abyssinian Bil&aacute;l, the original
Mu&euml;ddin of Isl&aacute;m, and ever a devoted disciple of the
Prophet. These and others from the &#7730;ureysh raised the
number of Muslims to more than thirty souls by the
fourth year of Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s mission&mdash;thirty in three long
years, and few of them men of influence!</p>

<p>This small success had been achieved with very little
opposition from the idolaters. Mo&#7717;ammad had not spoken
much in public; and when he did speak to strangers, he
restrained himself from attacking their worship, and only
enjoined them to worship the One God who had created
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[Pg&nbsp;xlvi]</a></span>
all things. The people were rather interested, and wondered
whether he were a soothsayer or madman, or if
indeed there were truth in his words. But now (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 615)
Mo&#7717;ammad entered upon a more public career. He summoned
the &#7730;ureysh to a conference at the hill of E&#7779;-&#7778;af&aacute;, and
said, &#8216;I am come to you as a warner, and as the forerunner
of a fearful punishment.... I cannot protect you in this
world, nor can I promise you aught in the next life, unless
ye say, There is no God but All&aacute;h.&#8217; He was laughed
to scorn, and the assembly broke up; but from this time
he ceased not to preach to the people of a punishment
that would come upon the unbelieving city. He told
them, in the fiery language of the early soorahs, how God
had punished the old tribes of the Arabs who would not
believe in His messengers, how the Flood had swallowed
up the people who would not hearken to Noah. He
swore unto them, by the wonderful sights of nature, by
the noonday brightness, by the night when she spreadeth
her veil, by the day when it appeareth in glory, that a
like destruction would assuredly come upon them if they
did not turn away from their idols and serve God alone.
He enforced his message with every resource of language
and metaphor, till he made it burn in the ears of the
people. And then he told them of the Last Day, when a
just reckoning should be taken of the deeds they had
done; and he spoke of Paradise and Hell with all the
glow of Eastern imagery. The people were moved, terrified;
conversions increased. It was time the &#7730;ureysh
should take some step. If the idols were destroyed,
what would come to them, the keepers of the idols, and
their renown throughout the land? How should they
retain the allegiance of the neighbouring tribes who came
to worship their several divinities at the Ka&#7841;beh? That
a few should follow the ravings of a madman or magician
who preferred one god above the beautiful deities of Mekka
was little matter; but that some leading men of the city
should join the sect, and that the magician should terrify the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[Pg&nbsp;xlvii]</a></span>
people in open day with his denunciations of the worship
which <i>they</i> superintended, was intolerable. The chiefs
were seriously alarmed, and resolved on a more active
policy. Hitherto they had merely ridiculed the professors
of this new faith; they would now take stronger
measures. Mo&#7717;ammad himself they dared not touch; for
he belonged to a noble family, which, though it was
reduced and impoverished, had deserved well of the city,
and which, moreover, was now headed by a man who
was reverenced throughout Mekka, and was none other
than the adoptive father and protector of Mo&#7717;ammad
himself. Nor was it safe to attack the other chief
men among the Muslims, for the blood-revenge was
no light risk. They were thus compelled to content
themselves with the mean satisfaction of torturing the
black slaves who had joined the obnoxious faction. They
exposed them on the scorching sand, and withheld water
till they recanted&mdash;which they did, only to profess the
faith once more when they were let go. The first Mu&euml;ddin
alone remained steadfast: as he lay half stifled he
would only answer, &#8216;A&#7717;ad! A&#7717;ad!&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;One [God]! One!&#8217;&mdash;till
Aboo-Bekr came and bought his freedom, as he was
wont to do for many of the miserable victims. Mo&#7717;ammad
was very gentle with these forced renegades: he
knew what stuff men are made of, and he bade them be
of good cheer for their lips, so that their hearts were sound.</p>

<p>At last, moved by the sufferings of his lowly followers,
he advised them to seek a refuge in Abyssinia&mdash;&#8216;a land
of righteousness, wherein no man is wronged;&#8217; and in the
fifth year of his mission (616) eleven men and four women
left Mekka secretly, and were received in Abyssinia with
welcome and peace. These first emigrants were followed
by more the next year, till the number reached one
hundred. The &#7730;ureysh were very wroth at the escape of
their victims, and sent ambassadors to the Nej&aacute;shee, the
Christian king of Abyssinia, to demand that the refugees
should be given up to them. But the Nej&aacute;shee assembled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[Pg&nbsp;xlviii]</a></span>
his bishops and sent for the Muslims and asked them why
they had fled; and one of them answered and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;O king! we lived in ignorance, idolatry, and unchastity;
the strong oppressed the weak; we spoke untruth;
we violated the duties of hospitality. Then a prophet
arose, one whom we knew from our youth, with whose
descent and conduct and good faith and morality we are
all well acquainted. He told us to worship one God, to
speak truth, to keep good faith, to assist our relations, to
fulfil the rights of hospitality, and to abstain from all
things impure, ungodly, unrighteous. And he ordered us
to say prayers, give alms, and to fast. We believed in
him; we followed him. But our countrymen persecuted
us, tortured us, and tried to cause us to forsake our religion;
and now we throw ourselves upon thy protection.
Wilt thou not protect us?&#8217; And he recited a chapter of
the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, which spoke of Christ; and the king and the
bishops wept upon their beards. And the king dismissed
the messengers and would not give up the men.</p>

<p>The &#7730;ureysh, foiled in their attempt to recapture the
slaves, vented their malice on those believers who remained.
Insults were heaped upon the Muslims, and persecution
grew hotter each day. For a moment Mo&#7717;ammad faltered
in his work. Could he not spare his people these sufferings?
Was it impossible to reconcile the religion of the
city with the belief in one supreme God? After all, was
the worship of those idols so false a thing? did it not hold
the germ of a great truth? And so Mo&#7717;ammad made his
first and last concession. He recited a revelation to the
&#7730;ureysh, in which he spoke respectfully of the three moon-goddesses,
and asserted that their intercession with God
might be hoped for: &#8216;Wherefore bow down before God
and serve Him;&#8217; and the whole audience, overjoyed at
the compromise, bowed down and worshipped at the name
of the God of Mo&#7717;ammad&mdash;the whole city was reconciled
to the double religion. But this Dreamer of the Desert
was not the man to rest upon a lie. At the price of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[Pg&nbsp;xlix]</a></span>
whole city of Mekka he would not remain untrue to himself.
He came forward and said he had done wrong&mdash;the
devil had tempted him. He openly and frankly
retracted what he had said: and &#8216;As for their idols,
they were but empty names which they and their fathers
had invented.&#8217;</p>

<p>Western biographers have rejoiced greatly over &#8216;Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s
fall.&#8217; Yet it was a tempting compromise, and
few would have withstood it. And the life of Mo&#7717;ammad
is not the life of a god, but of a man: from first
to last it is intensely human. But if for once he was
not superior to the temptation of gaining over the whole
city and obtaining peace where before there was only
bitter persecution, what can we say of his manfully
thrusting back the rich prize he had gained, freely
confessing his fault, and resolutely giving himself over
again to the old indignities and insults? If he was
once insincere&mdash;and who is not?&mdash;how intrepid was his
after-sincerity! He was untrue to himself for a while,
and he is ever referring to it in his public preaching with
shame and remorse; but the false step was more than
atoned for by his magnificent recantation.</p>

<p>Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s influence with the people at large was
certainly weakened by this temporary change of front,
and the opposition of the leaders of the &#7730;ureysh, checked
for the moment by the Prophet&#8217;s concession, now that he
had repudiated it, broke forth into fiercer flame. They
heaped insults upon him, and he could not traverse
the city without the encounter of a curse. They threw
unclean things at him, and vexed him in his every doing.
The protection of Aboo-&#7788;&aacute;lib alone saved him from
personal danger. This refuge the &#7730;ureysh determined
to remove. They had attempted before, but had been
turned back with a soft answer. They now went to
the chief, of fourscore years, and demanded that he
should either compel his nephew to hold his peace, or
else that he should withdraw his protection. Having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[Pg&nbsp;l]</a></span>
thus spoken they departed. The old man sent for Mo&#7717;ammad,
and told him what they had said. &#8216;Now therefore
save thyself and me also, and cast not upon me a burden
heavier than I can bear;&#8217; for he was grieved at the strife
between his family and his wider kindred, and would fain
have seen Mo&#7717;ammad temporize with the &#7730;ureysh. But
though the Prophet believed that at length his uncle was
indeed about to abandon him, his courage and high resolve
never faltered. &#8216;Though they should set the sun on my
right hand and the moon on my left to persuade me, yet
while God commands me I will not renounce my purpose.&#8217;
But to lose his uncle&#8217;s love!&mdash;he burst into tears,
and turned to go. But Aboo-&#7788;&aacute;lib called aloud, &#8216;Son
of my brother, come back.&#8217; So he came. And he said,
&#8216;Depart in peace, my nephew, and say whatsoever thou
desirest; for, by the Lord, I will never deliver thee up.&#8217;</p>

<p>The faithfulness of Aboo-&#7788;&aacute;lib was soon to be tried.
At first, indeed, things looked brighter. The old chief&#8217;s
firm bearing overawed the &#7730;ureysh, and they were still
more cowed by two great additions that were now joined
to the Muslim ranks. One was Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s uncle,
&#7716;amzeh, &#8216;the Lion of God,&#8217; a mighty hunter and warrior
of the true Arab mettle, whose sword was worth twenty of
weaker men to the cause of Isl&aacute;m. The other was &acute;Omar,
afterwards Khalif, whose fierce impulsive nature had
hitherto marked him as a violent opponent of the new
faith, but who afterwards proved himself one of the mainstays
of Isl&aacute;m. The gain of two such men first frightened
then maddened the &#7730;ureysh. The leaders met together
and consulted what they should do. It was no longer a
case of an enthusiast followed by a crowd of slaves and a
few worthy merchants; it was a faction led by stout
warriors, such as &#7716;amzeh, &#7788;al&#7717;ah, &acute;Omar,&mdash;half-a-dozen
picked swordsmen; and the Muslims, emboldened by their
new allies, were boldly surrounding the Ka&#7841;beh, and performing
the rites of their religion in the face of all the
people. The &#7730;ureysh resolved on extreme measures.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[Pg&nbsp;li]</a></span>
They determined to shut off the obnoxious family of the
H&aacute;shimees from the rest of their kindred. The chiefs
drew up a document, in which they vowed that they
would not marry with the H&aacute;shimees, nor buy and sell
with them, nor hold with them any communication soever;
and this they hung up in the Ka&#7841;beh.</p>

<p>The H&aacute;shimees were not many enough to fight the
whole city, so they went every man of them, save one, to
the shi-b (or quarter) of Aboo-&#7788;&aacute;lib,&mdash;a long, narrow
mountain defile on the eastern skirts of Mekka, cut off by
rocks or walls from the city, except for one narrow gateway,&mdash;and
there shut themselves up. For though the ban
did not forbid them to go about as heretofore, they knew
that no soul would speak with them, and that they would
be subject to the maltreatment of any vagabond they met.
So they collected their stores and waited. Every man of
the family, Muslim or Pagan, cast in his lot with their
common kinsman, Mo&#7717;ammad, saving only his own uncle,
Aboo-Lahab, a determined enemy to Isl&aacute;m, to whom a
special denunciation is justly consecrated in the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n.</p>

<p>For two long years the H&aacute;shimees remained shut up in
their quarter. Only at the pilgrimage-time&mdash;when the
blessed institution of the sacred months made violence
sacrilege&mdash;could Mo&#7717;ammad come forth and speak unto
the people of the things that were in his heart to say.
Scarcely any converts were made during this weary time;
and most of those who had previously been converted,
and did not belong to the doomed clan, took refuge in
Abyssinia; so that in the seventh year of Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s
mission there were probably not more than twelve Muslims
of any weight who remained by him. Still the H&aacute;shimees
remained in their quarter. It seemed as if they must all
perish: their stores were almost gone, and the cries of
starving children could be heard outside. Kind-hearted
neighbours would sometimes smuggle-in a camel&#8217;s load of
food, but it availed little. The &#7730;ureysh themselves were
getting ashamed of their work, and were wishing for an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[Pg&nbsp;lii]</a></span>
excuse for releasing their kinsmen. The excuse came in
time. It was discovered that the deed of ban was eaten
up by worms, and Aboo-&#7788;&aacute;lib turned the discovery to his
advantage. The venerable old chief went out and met
the &#7730;ureysh at the Ka&#7841;beh, and pointing to the crumbling
leaf he bitterly reproached them with their hardness
of heart towards their brethren: then he departed.
And straightway there rose up five chiefs, heads of great
families, and, amid the murmurs of the fiercer spirits who
were still for no quarter, they put on their armour, and
going to the shi-b of Aboo-&#7788;&aacute;lib, bade the H&aacute;shimees
come forth in peace. And they came forth.</p>

<p>It was now the eighth year of Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s mission;
and for the last two years, wasted in excommunication,
Isl&aacute;m had almost stood still, at least externally. For
though Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s patient bearing under the ban had
gained over a few of his imprisoned clan to his side, he
had made no converts beyond the walls of his quarter.
During the sacred months he had gone forth to speak to
the people,&mdash;to the caravans of strangers and the folk at
the fairs,&mdash;but he had no success; for hard behind him
followed Aboo-Lahab, the squinter, who mocked at him,
and told the people he was only &#8216;a liar and a sabian.&#8217;
And the people answered that his own kindred must best
know what he was, and they would hear nothing from
him. The bold conduct of the five chiefs had indeed
secured for Mo&#7717;ammad a temporary respite from persecution;
but this relief was utterly outweighed by the troubles
that now fell upon him and fitly gave that year the name
of &#8216;The Year of Mourning.&#8217; For soon after the revoking of
the ban Aboo-&#7788;&aacute;lib died, and five weeks later Khadeejeh.
In the first Mo&#7717;ammad lost his ancient protector, who,
though he would never give up his old belief, had yet
faithfully guarded the Prophet from his childhood upwards,
and, with the true Arab sentiment of kinship, had
subjected himself and his clan to years of persecution and
poverty in order to defend his brother&#8217;s son from his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[Pg&nbsp;liii]</a></span>
enemies. The death of Khadeejeh was even a heavier
calamity to Mo&#7717;ammad. She first had believed in him,
and she had ever been his angel of hope and consolation.
To his death he cherished a tender regret for her; and
when his young bride &acute;&Aacute;&iuml;sheh, the favourite of his declining
years, jealously abused &#8216;that toothless old woman,&#8217; he
answered with indignation, &#8216;When I was poor, she enriched
me; when they called me a liar, she alone believed in me;
when all the world was against me, she alone remained
true.&#8217;</p>

<p>Mo&#7717;ammad might well feel himself alone in the world.
Most of his followers were in Abyssinia; only a few tried
friends remained at Mekka. All the city was against
him; his protector was dead, and his faithful wife. Dejected,
almost hopeless, he would try a new field. If
Mekka rejected him, might not Et-&#7788;&aacute;&iuml;f give him welcome?
He set out on foot on his journey of seventy miles, taking
only Zeyd with him; and he told the people of Et-&#7788;&aacute;&iuml;f
his simple message. They stoned him out of the city for
three miles. Bleeding and fainting, he paused to rest in
an orchard, to recover strength before he went back to the
insults of his own people. The owners of the place sent
him some grapes; and he gathered up his strength once
more, and bent his weary feet towards Mekka. On the
way, as he slept, his fancy called up a strange dream: men
had rejected him, and now he thought he saw the Jinn, the
spirits of the air, falling down and worshipping the One
God, and bearing witness to the truth of Isl&aacute;m. Heartened
by the vision, he pushed on; and when Zeyd asked him if
he did not fear to throw himself again into the hands of
the &#7730;ureysh, he answered, &#8216;God will protect His religion
and help His prophet.&#8217;</p>

<p>So this lonely man came back to dwell among his
enemies. Though a brave Arab gentleman, compassionating
his aloneness, gave him the Bedawee pledge of protection,
yet he well knew that the power of his foes made
such protection almost useless, and at any time he might
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[Pg&nbsp;liv]</a></span>
be assassinated. But the &#7730;ureysh had not yet come to
think of the last resource, and meanwhile a new prospect
was opening out for Mo&#7717;ammad. That same year, as he
was visiting the caravans of the pilgrims who had come
from all parts of Arabia to worship at the Ka&#7841;beh, he
found a group of men of Yethrib who were willing to
listen to his words. He expounded to them the faith he
was sent to preach, and he told them how his people had
rejected him, and asked them whether Yethrib would
receive him. The men were impressed with his words
and professed Isl&aacute;m, and promised to bring news the next
year; then they returned home and talked of this matter
to their brethren. Now at Yethrib, besides two pagan
tribes that had migrated upwards from the south, there
were three clans of Jewish Arabs. Between the pagans
and Jews, and then between the two pagan clans, there
had been deadly wars; and now there were many parties
in the city, and no one was master. The Jews, on the
one hand, were expecting their Messiah; the pagans
looked for a prophet. If Mo&#7717;ammad were not the Messiah,
the Jews thought that he might at least be their
tool to subdue their pagan rivals. &#8216;Whether he is a prophet
or not,&#8217; said the pagans, &#8216;he is our kinsman by his
mother, and will help us to overawe the Jews; and if he
is the coming prophet, it is our policy to recognise him
before those Jews who are always threatening us with
their Messiah.&#8217; The teaching of Mo&#7717;ammad was so nearly
Jewish, that a union of the two creeds might be hoped
for; whilst to the pagan Arabs of Yethrib monotheism was
no strange doctrine. All parties were therefore willing
to receive Mo&#7717;ammad and at least try the experiment of
his influence. As a peace-maker, prophet, or messiah, he
would be equally welcome in a city torn asunder by party
jealousies.</p>

<p>When the time of pilgrimage again came round, Mo&#7717;ammad
waited at the appointed place in a secluded glen,
and there met him men from the two pagan tribes of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[Pg&nbsp;lv]</a></span>
Yethrib&mdash;the clans of Khazraj and Aws&mdash;ten from one
and two from the other. They told him of the willingness
of their people to embrace Isl&aacute;m, and their hope to make
ready the city for his welcome. They plighted their faith
with him in these words: &#8216;We will not worship save one
God; we will not steal, nor commit adultery, nor kill our
children; we will in nowise slander, nor will we disobey
the prophet in anything that is right.&#8217; This is the first
pledge of the &acute;A&#7731;abeh.</p>

<p>The twelve men of Yethrib went back and preached
Isl&aacute;m to their people. &#8216;So prepared was the ground, so
zealous the propagation, and so apt the method, that the new
faith spread rapidly from house to house and from tribe to
tribe. The Jews looked on in amazement at the people,
whom they had in vain endeavoured for generations to
convince of the errors of Polytheism and dissuade from
the abominations of idolatry, suddenly and of their own
accord casting away their idols and professing belief in
God alone.&#8217; They asked Mo&#7717;ammad to send them a
teacher versed in the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, so anxious were they to
know Isl&aacute;m truly; and Mu&#7779;&acute;ab was sent, and taught them
and conducted their worship; so that Isl&aacute;m took deep root
at Yethrib.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mo&#7717;ammad was still among the &#7730;ureysh at
Mekka. His is now an attitude of waiting; he is listening
for news from his distant converts. Resting his hopes upon
them, and despairing of influencing the Mekkans, he does
not preach so much as heretofore. He holds his peace
mainly, and bides his time. One hears little of this
interval of quietude. Isl&aacute;m seems stationary at Mekka,
and its followers are silent and reserved. The &#7730;ureysh
are joyful at the ceasing of those denunciations which
terrified whilst they angered them, yet they are not quite
satisfied. The Muslims have a waiting look, as though
there were something at hand.</p>

<p>It was during this year of expectation that the Prophet&#8217;s
celebrated &#8216;Night Journey&#8217; took place. This Mi&acute;r&aacute;j has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[Pg&nbsp;lvi]</a></span>
been the subject of extravagant embellishments on the
part of the traditionists and commentators, and the cause
of much obloquy to the Prophet from his religious opponents.
Mo&#7717;ammad dreamed a dream, and referred to it
briefly and obscurely in the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n. His followers persisted
in believing it to have been a reality&mdash;an ascent to heaven
in the body&mdash;till Mo&#7717;ammad was sick of repeating his
simple assertion that it was a dream. The traditional form
of this wonderful vision may be read in any life of Mo&#7717;ammad,
and though it is doubtless very different from the
story the Prophet himself gave, it is still a grand vision,
full of glorious imagery, fraught with deep meaning.</p>

<p>Again the time of pilgrimage came round, and again
Mo&#7717;ammad repaired to the glen of the Mountain-road.
Mu&#7779;&acute;ab had told him the good tidings of the spread of the
faith at Yethrib, and he was met at the rendezvous by more
than seventy men. They came by twos and threes secretly
for fear of the &#7730;ureysh, &#8216;waking not the sleeper, nor tarrying
for the absent.&#8217; Then Mo&#7717;ammad recited to them
verses from the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, and in answer to their invitation
that he should come to them, and their profession that their
lives were at his service, he asked them to pledge themselves
to defend him as they would their own wives and children.
And a murmur of eager assent rolled round about from
the seventy, and an old man, one of their chiefs, stood
forth and said, &#8216;Stretch out thy hand, O Mo&#7717;ammad.&#8217;
And the chief struck his own hand into Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s
palm in the frank Bedawee fashion, and thus pledged his
fealty. Man after man the others followed, and struck
their hands upon Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s. Then he chose twelve of
them as leaders over the rest, saying, &#8216;Moses chose from
among his people twelve leaders. Ye shall be the sureties
for the rest, even as the apostles of Jesus were; and I am
the surety for my people.&#8217; A voice of some stranger was
heard near by, and the assembly hastily dispersed and
stole back to their camp. This is the second pledge of
the &acute;A&#7731;abeh.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[Pg&nbsp;lvii]</a></span></p>

<p>The &#7730;ureysh knew that some meeting had taken place,
and though they could not bring home the offence to any
of the Yethrib pilgrims, they kept a stricter watch on the
movements of Mo&#7717;ammad and his friends after the pilgrims
had returned homeward. It was clear that Mekka was no
longer a safe place for the Muslims, and a few days after
the second pledge Mo&#7717;ammad told his followers to betake
themselves secretly to Yethrib. For two months at the
beginning of the eleventh year of the mission (622) the
Muslims were leaving Mekka in small companies to make
the journey of 250 miles to Yethrib. One hundred families
had gone, and whole quarters of the city were deserted,
left with empty houses and locked doors, &#8216;a prey to woe and
wind.&#8217; There were but three believers now remaining in
Mekka&mdash;these were Mo&#7717;ammad, Aboo-Bekr, and &acute;Alee.
Like the captain of a sinking ship, the Prophet would not
leave till all the crew were safe. But now they were all
gone save his two early friends, and everything was ready for
the journey; still the Prophet did not go. But the &#7730;ureysh,
who had been too much taken by surprise to prevent the
emigration, now prepared measures for a summary vengeance
on the disturber of their peace and the emptier of
their city. They set a watch on his house, and, it is said,
commissioned a band of armed youths of different families
to assassinate him together, that the blood recompense
might not fall on one household alone. But Mo&#7717;ammad
had warning of his danger, and leaving &acute;Alee to deceive
the enemy, he was concealed with Aboo-Bekr in a narrow-mouthed
cave on Mount Th&oacute;r, an hour-and-a-half&#8217;s journey
from Mekka, before the &#7730;ureysh knew of his escape. For
three days they remained hidden there, while their enemies
were searching the country for them. Once they were
very near, and Aboo-Bekr trembled:&mdash;&#8216;We are but two.&#8217;
&#8216;Nay,&#8217; answered Mo&#7717;ammad, &#8216;we are three, for God is
with us.&#8217; And a spider, they say, wove its web over the
entrance of the cave, so that the &#7730;ureysh passed on, thinking
that no man had entered there.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[Pg&nbsp;lviii]</a></span></p>

<p>On the third night the pursuit had been almost given
over, and the two fugitives took up their journey again.
Mounted on camels they journeyed to Yethrib. In eight
days they reached the outskirts of the city (September
622). Mo&#7717;ammad was received with acclamation, and
took up his residence among his kindred. The seat of
Isl&aacute;m was transferred from Mekka to Yethrib, henceforward
to be known as Medina,&mdash;<i>Medeenet-en-Nebee</i>, &#8216;the
City of the Prophet.&#8217;</p>

<p>This is the <i>Hijreh</i>, or Flight of the Prophet, from which
the Muslims date their history. Their first year began
on the 16th day of June of the Year of Grace 622.</p>

<hr />

<p>A great change now comes over the Prophet&#8217;s life. It
is still the same man, but the surroundings are totally
different; the work to be done is on a wider, rougher
stage. Thus far we have seen a gentle, thoughtful boy
tending the sheep round Mekka;&mdash;a young man of little
note, of whom the people only knew that he was pure
and upright and true;&mdash;then a man of forty whose solitary
communion with his soul has pressed him to the
last terrible questions that each man, if he will think at
all, must some time ask himself&mdash;What is life? What
does this world mean? What is reality, what is truth?
Long months, years perhaps, we know not how long and
weary, filled with the tortures of doubt and the despair of
ever attaining to the truth, filled with the dreary thought
of his aloneness in the relentless universe, and the longing
to end it all, brought at last their fruits&mdash;sure conviction
of the great secret of life, a firm belief in the Creator
in whom all things live and move and have their being,
whom to serve is man&#8217;s highest duty and privilege, the
one thing to be done. And then ten years of struggling
with careless, unthinking idolators; ten years of slow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[Pg&nbsp;lix]</a></span>
results, the gaining over of a few close friends, the devoted
attachment of some slaves and men of the meaner rank;
finally, the conversion of half-a-dozen great citizen chiefs,
ending in the flight of the whole brotherhood of believers
from their native city and their welcome to a town of
strangers, where the faith had forced itself home to the
hearts of perhaps two hundred citizens. It was but
little that was done; so many years of toil, of indomitable
courage and perseverance and long-suffering, and only
about three hundred converts at the end! But it was the
seed of a great harvest. Mo&#7717;ammad had shown men what
he was; the nobility of his character, his strong friendship,
his endurance and courage, above all, his earnestness
and fiery enthusiasm for the truth he came to preach,&mdash;these
things had revealed the hero, the master whom it
was alike impossible to disobey and impossible not to love.
Henceforward it is only a question of time. As the men
of Medina come to know Mo&#7717;ammad, they too will devote
themselves to him body and soul; and the enthusiasm
will catch fire and spread among the tribes till all Arabia
is at the feet of the Prophet of the One God. &#8216;No emperor
with his tiaras was obeyed as this man in a cloak of His
own clouting.&#8217; He had the gift of influencing men, and
he had the nobility only to influence them for good.</p>

<p>We have now to see Mo&#7717;ammad as king. Though he
came as a fugitive, rejected as an impostor by his own
citizens, yet it was not long before his word was supreme
in his adopted city. He had to rule over a mixed and
divided people, and this must have helped him to the
supreme voice. There were four distinct parties at Medina.
First, the &#8216;Refugees&#8217; (Mu&#7717;&aacute;jiroon), who had fled from
Mekka; on these Mo&#7717;ammad could always rely with implicit
faith. But he attached equal importance to the early
converts of Medina, who had invited him among them and
given him a home when the future seemed very hopeless
before him, and who were thenceforward known by the
honourable title of the &#8216;Helpers&#8217; (An&#7779;&aacute;r). How devoted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">[Pg&nbsp;lx]</a></span>
was the affection of these men is shown by the well-known
scene at El-Ji&acute;r&aacute;neh, when the Helpers were discontented
with their share of the spoils, and Mo&#7717;ammad
answered, &#8216;Why are ye disturbed in mind because of the
things of this life wherewith I have sought to incline the
hearts of these men of Mekka into Isl&aacute;m, whereas ye are
already steadfast in the faith? Are ye not satisfied that
others should obtain the flocks and the camels, while ye
carry back the Prophet of the Lord unto your homes?
Nay, I will not leave you for ever. If all mankind went
one way, and the men of Medina went another way, verily
I would go the way of the men of Medina. The Lord be
favourable unto them, and bless them, and their sons, and
their sons&#8217; sons, for ever!&#8217; And the &#8216;Helpers&#8217; wept upon
their beards, and cried with one voice, &#8216;Yea, we are well
satisfied, O Prophet, with our lot.&#8217; To retain the allegiance
of the Refugees and the Helpers was never a trouble
to Mo&#7717;ammad; the only difficulty was to rein in their
zeal and hold them back from doing things of blood and
vengeance on the enemies of Isl&aacute;m. To prevent the danger
of jealousy between the Refugees and the Helpers,
Mo&#7717;ammad assigned each Refugee to one of the An&#7779;&aacute;r
to be his brother; and this tie of gossipry superseded
all nearer ties, till Mo&#7717;ammad saw the time was over
when it was needed. The third party in Medina was
that of the &#8216;Disaffected,&#8217; or in the language of Isl&aacute;m
the &#8216;Hypocrites&#8217; (Mun&aacute;fi&#7731;oon). This was composed of
the large body of men who gave in their nominal allegiance
to Mo&#7717;ammad and his religion when they saw they
could not safely withstand his power, but who were always
ready to turn about if they thought there was a chance of
his overthrow. Mo&#7717;ammad treated these men and their
leader &acute;Abdallah ibn Ubayy (who himself aspired to the
sovranty of Medina) with patient courtesy and friendliness,
and, though they actually deserted him more than
once at vitally critical moments, he never retaliated, even
when he was strong enough to crush them, but rather
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi">[Pg&nbsp;lxi]</a></span>
sought to win them over heartily to his cause by treating
them as though they were what he would have them be.
The result was that this party gradually diminished and
became absorbed in the general mass of earnest Muslims,
and though up to its leader&#8217;s death it constantly called
forth Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s powers of conciliation, after that it
vanished from the history of parties.</p>

<p>The fourth party was the real thorn in the Prophet&#8217;s
side. It consisted of the Jews, of whom three tribes were
settled in the suburbs of Medina. They had at first been
well disposed to Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s coming. He could not
indeed be the Messiah, because he was not of the lineage
of David; but he would do very well to pass off upon
their neighbours, the pagan Arabs, as, if not the Messiah,
at least a great prophet; and by his influence the Jews
might regain their old supremacy in Medina. Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s
teaching was very nearly Jewish&mdash;they had taught
him the fables of their Haggadah, and he believed in their
prophets&mdash;why should he not be one of them and help
them to the dominion? When Mo&#7717;ammad came, they
found out their mistake; instead of a tool they had a
master. He told the people, indeed, the stories of the
Midrash, and he professed to revive the religion of Abraham:
but he added to this several damning articles; he
taught that Jesus <i>was</i> the Messiah, and that no other
Messiah was to be looked for; and, moreover, whilst reverencing
and inculcating the doctrine of the Hebrew prophets
and of Christ, as he knew it, he yet insisted on his own
mission as in nowise inferior to theirs&mdash;as, in fact, the seal
of prophecy by which all that went before was confirmed
or abrogated. The illusion was over; the Jews would
have nothing to say to Isl&aacute;m: they set themselves instead
to oppose it, ridicule it, and vex its Preacher in every way
that their notorious ingenuity could devise.</p>

<p>The step was false: the Jews missed their game, and
they had to pay for it. Whether it was possible to form
a coalition,&mdash;whether the Jews might have induced Mo&#7717;ammad
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">[Pg&nbsp;lxii]</a></span>
to waive certain minor points if they recognised
his prophetic mission,&mdash;it is difficult to say. It seems most
probable that Mo&#7717;ammad would not have yielded a jot to
their demands, and would have accepted nothing short of
unconditional surrender to his religion. And it is at least
doubtful whether Isl&aacute;m would have gained anything by a
further infusion of Judaism. It already contained all that
it could assimilate of the Hebrew faith; the rest was too
narrow for the universal scope of Isl&aacute;m. The religion of
Mo&#7717;ammad lost little, we may be sure, by the standing
aloof of the Arabian Jews; but the Jews themselves lost
much. Mo&#7717;ammad, indeed, treated them kindly so long
as kindness was possible. He made a treaty with them,
whereby the rights of the Muslims and the Jews were
defined. They were to practise their several religions unmolested;
protection and security were promised to all the
parties to the treaty, irrespective of creed; each was to
help the other if attacked; no alliance was to be made
with the &#7730;ureysh; war was to be made in common, and
no war could be made without the consent of Mo&#7717;ammad:
crime alone could do away with the protection of this
treaty.</p>

<p>But the Jews would not content themselves with standing
aloof; they must needs act on the offensive. They
began by asking Mo&#7717;ammad hard questions out of their
law, and his answers they easily refuted from their books.
They denied all knowledge of the Jewish stories in the
&#7730;ur-&aacute;n&mdash;though they knew that they came from their own
Haggadah, which was ever in their mouths in their own
quarter,&mdash;and they showed him their Bible, where, of
course, the Haggadistic legends were not to be found.
Mo&#7717;ammad had but one course open to him&mdash;to say they
had suppressed or changed their books; and he denounced
them accordingly, and said that his was the true account
of the patriarchs and prophets, revealed from heaven. Not
satisfied with tormenting Mo&#7717;ammad with questions on
that T&oacute;rah which they were always wrangling about themselves,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">[Pg&nbsp;lxiii]</a></span>
they took hold of the every day formulas of Isl&aacute;m,
the daily prayers and ejaculations, and, &#8216;twisting their
tongues,&#8217; mispronounced them so that they meant something
absurd or blasphemous. When asked which they
preferred, Isl&aacute;m or idolatry, they frankly avowed that they
preferred idolatry. To lie about their own religion and
to ridicule another religion that was doing a great and
good work around them was not enough for these Jews;
they must set their poets to work to lampoon the women
of the believers in obscene verse, and such outrages upon
common decency, not to say upon the code of Arab honour
and chivalry, became a favourite occupation among the
poets of the Jewish clans.</p>

<p>These were offences against the religion and the persons
of the Muslims. They also conspired against the state.
Mo&#7717;ammad was not only the preacher of Isl&aacute;m, he was
also the king of Medina, and was responsible for the safety
and peace of the city. As a prophet, he could afford to
ignore the jibes of the Jews, though they maddened him
to fury; but as the chief of the city, the general in a time
of almost continual warfare, when Medina was kept in
a state of military defence and under a sort of military
discipline, he could not overlook treachery. He was
bound by his duty to his subjects to suppress a party
that might (and nearly did) lead to the sack of the
city by investing armies. The measures he took for this
object have furnished his European biographers with a
handle for attack. It is, I believe, solely on the ground
of his treatment of the Jews that Mo&#7717;ammad has been
called &#8216;a bloodthirsty tyrant:&#8217; it would certainly be difficult
to support the epithet on other grounds.</p>

<p>The bloodthirstiness consists in this: some half-dozen
Jews, who had distinguished themselves by their virulence
against the Muslims, or by their custom of carrying information
to the common enemy of Medina, were executed;
two of the three Jewish clans were sent into exile, just as
they had previously come into exile, and the third was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxiv" id="Page_lxiv">[Pg&nbsp;lxiv]</a></span>
exterminated&mdash;the men killed, and the women and children
made slaves. The execution of the half-dozen marked
Jews is generally called assassination, because a Muslim
was sent secretly to kill each of the criminals. The reason
is almost too obvious to need explanation. There were
no police or law-courts or even courts-martial at Medina;
some one of the followers of Mo&#7717;ammad must therefore be
the executor of the sentence of death, and it was better it
should be done quietly, as the executing of a man openly
before his clan would have caused a brawl and more bloodshed
and retaliation, till the whole city had become mixed
up in the quarrel. If secret assassination is the word for
such deeds, secret assassination was a necessary part of the
internal government of Medina. The men must be killed,
and best in that way. In saying this I assume that Mo&#7717;ammad
was cognisant of the deed, and that it was not
merely a case of private vengeance; but in several instances
the evidence that traces these executions to Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s
order is either entirely wanting or is too doubtful to claim
our credence.</p>

<p>Of the sentences upon the three whole clans, that of
exile, passed upon two of them, was clement enough.
They were a turbulent set, always setting the people of
Medina by the ears; and finally a brawl followed by an
insurrection resulted in the expulsion of one tribe; and
insubordination, alliance with enemies, and a suspicion of
conspiracy against the Prophet&#8217;s life, ended similarly for
the second. Both tribes had violated the original treaty,
and had endeavoured in every way to bring Mo&#7717;ammad
and his religion to ridicule and destruction. The only
question is whether their punishment was not too light.
Of the third clan a fearful example was made, not by
Mo&#7717;ammad, but by an arbiter appointed by themselves.
When the &#7730;ureysh and their allies were besieging Medina,
and had well-nigh stormed the defences, this Jewish tribe
entered into negotiations with the enemy, which were only
circumvented by the diplomacy of the Prophet. When
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxv" id="Page_lxv">[Pg&nbsp;lxv]</a></span>
the besiegers had retired, Mo&#7717;ammad naturally demanded
an explanation of the Jews. They resisted in their dogged
way, and were themselves besieged and compelled to surrender
at discretion. Mo&#7717;ammad, however, consented to
the appointing of a chief of a tribe allied to the Jews as
the judge who should pronounce sentence upon them.
The man in question was a fierce soldier, who had been
wounded in the attack on the Jews, and indeed died from
his wound the same day. This chief gave sentence that
the men, in number some six hundred, should be killed,
and the women and children enslaved; and the sentence
was carried out. It was a harsh, bloody sentence, worthy
of the episcopal generals of the army against the Albigenses,
or of the deeds of the Augustan age of Puritanism;
but it must be remembered that the crime of these men
was high treason against the State, during time of siege;
and those who have read how Wellington&#8217;s march could be
traced by the bodies of deserters and pillagers hanging
from the trees, need not be surprized at the summary
execution of a traitorous clan.</p>

<p>Whilst Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s supremacy was being established
and maintained among the mixed population of Mekka, a
vigorous warfare was being carried on outside with his old
persecutors, the &#7730;ureysh. On the history of this war,
consisting as it did mainly of small raids and attacks upon
caravans, I need not dwell; its leading features were the two
battles of Bedr and O&#7717;ud, in the first of which three hundred
Muslims, though outnumbered at the odds of three to
one, were completely victorious (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 624, <span class="smcap">a.h.</span> 2); whilst
at O&#7717;ud, being outnumbered in the like proportion and
deserted by the &#8216;Disaffected&#8217; party, they were almost as
decisively defeated (<span class="smcap">a.h.</span> 3). Two years later the &#7730;ureysh,
gathering together their allies, advanced upon Medina
and besieged it for fifteen days; but the foresight of
Mo&#7717;ammad in digging a trench, and the enthusiasm of the
Muslims in defending it, resisted all assaults, and the coming
of the heavy storms for which the climate of Medina is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxvi" id="Page_lxvi">[Pg&nbsp;lxvi]</a></span>
noted drove the enemy back to Mekka. The next year
(<span class="smcap">a.h.</span> 6) a ten years&#8217; truce was concluded with the &#7730;ureysh,
in pursuance of which a strange scene took place in the
following spring. It was agreed that Mo&#7717;ammad and his
people should perform the Lesser Pilgrimage, and that the
&#7730;ureysh should for that purpose vacate Mekka for three
days. Accordingly, in March 629, about two thousand
Muslims, with Mo&#7717;ammad at their head on his famous
camel El-&#7730;a&#7779;w&aacute;&mdash;the same on which he had fled from
Mekka&mdash;trooped down the valley and performed the rites
which every Muslim to this day observes.</p>

<p>&#8216;It was surely a strange sight which at this time presented
itself in the vale of Mekka,&mdash;a sight unique in the
history of the world. The ancient city is for three days
evacuated by all its inhabitants, high and low, every house
deserted; and, as they retire, the exiled converts, many
years banished from their birthplace, approach in a great
body, accompanied by their allies, revisit the empty homes
of their childhood, and within the short allotted space
fulfil the rites of pilgrimage. The ousted inhabitants,
climbing the heights around, take refuge under tents or
other shelter among the hills and glens; and, clustering on
the overhanging peak of Aboo-&#7730;ubeys, thence watch the
movements of the visitors beneath, as with the Prophet at
their head they make the circuit of the Ka&#7841;beh and the rapid
procession between E&#7779;-&#7778;af&aacute; and Marwah; and anxiously
scan every figure if perchance they may recognise among
the worshippers some long-lost friend or relative. It was
a scene rendered possible only by the throes which gave
birth to Isl&aacute;m.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>When the three days were over, Mo&#7717;ammad and his
party peaceably returned to Medina; and the Mekkans
re-entered their homes. But this pilgrimage, and the self-restraint
of the Muslims therein, advanced the cause of
Isl&aacute;m among its enemies. Converts increased daily, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxvii" id="Page_lxvii">[Pg&nbsp;lxvii]</a></span>
some leading men of the &#7730;ureysh now went over to Mo&#7717;ammad.
The clans around were sending in their deputations
of homage. But the final keystone was set in the
eighth year of the flight (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 630), when a body of &#7730;ureysh
broke the truce by attacking an ally of the Muslims; and
Mo&#7717;ammad forthwith marched upon Mekka with ten
thousand men, and the city, defence being hopeless, surrendered.
Now was the time for the Prophet to show
his bloodthirsty nature. His old persecutors are at his
feet. Will he not trample on them, torture them, revenge
himself after his own cruel manner? Now the man will
come forward in his true colours: we may prepare our
horror, and cry shame beforehand.</p>

<p>But what is this? Is there no blood in the streets?
Where are the bodies of the thousands that have been
butchered? Facts are hard things; and it is a fact that
the day of Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s greatest triumph over his enemies
was also the day of his grandest victory over himself. He
freely forgave the &#7730;ureysh all the years of sorrow and
cruel scorn they had inflicted on him: he gave an
amnesty to the whole population of Mekka. Four
criminals, whom justice condemned, made up Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s
proscription list when he entered as a conqueror
the city of his bitterest enemies. The army followed
his example, and entered quietly and peaceably; no
house was robbed, no woman insulted. One thing alone
suffered destruction. Going to the Ka&#7841;beh, Mo&#7717;ammad
stood before each of the three hundred and sixty
idols and pointed to it with his staff, saying, &#8216;Truth is
come and lying is undone,&#8217; and at these words his
attendants hewed it down; and all the idols and household
gods of Mekka and round about were destroyed.</p>

<p>It was thus that Mo&#7717;ammad entered again his native
city. Through all the annals of conquest, there is no
triumphant entry like unto this one.</p>

<p>The taking of Mekka was soon followed by the adhesion
of all Arabia. Every reader knows the story of the spread
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxviii" id="Page_lxviii">[Pg&nbsp;lxviii]</a></span>
of Isl&aacute;m. The tribes of every part of the peninsula sent
embassies to do homage to the Prophet. Arabia was not
enough: the Prophet had written in his bold uncompromising
way to the great kings of the East, to the Persian
Khusru, and the Greek Emperor; and these little knew
how soon his invitation to the faith would be repeated,
and how quickly Isl&aacute;m would be knocking at their doors
with no faltering hand.</p>

<p>The Prophet&#8217;s career was near its end. In the tenth
year of the Flight, twenty years after he had first felt
the Spirit move him to preach to his people, he resolved
once more to leave his adopted city and go to Mekka
to perform a farewell pilgrimage. And when the rites
were done in the valley of Min&aacute;, the Prophet spoke unto
the multitude&mdash;the forty thousand pilgrims&mdash;with solemn
last words.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>&#8216;<span class="smcap">Ye People!</span> Hearken to my words; for I know not
whether after this year I shall ever be amongst you here
again.</p>

<p>&#8216;Your Lives and your Property are sacred and inviolable
amongst one another until the end of time.</p>

<p>&#8216;The Lord hath ordained to every man the share of his
inheritance: a Testament is not lawful to the prejudice of
heirs.</p>

<p>&#8216;The child belongeth to the Parent; and the violator
of Wedlock shall be stoned.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ye people! Ye have rights demandable of your Wives,
and they have rights demandable of you. Treat your
women well.</p>

<p>&#8216;And your Slaves, see that you feed them with such
food as ye eat yourselves, and clothe them with the stuff
ye wear. And if they commit a fault which ye are not
willing to forgive, then sell them, for they are the servants
of the Lord, and are not to be tormented.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxix" id="Page_lxix">[Pg&nbsp;lxix]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8216;Ye people! Hearken unto my speech and comprehend
it. Know that every Muslim is the brother of every
other Muslim. All of you are on the same equality: ye
are one Brotherhood.&#8217;</p>

<p>Then, looking up to heaven, he cried, &#8216;O Lord! I have
delivered my message and fulfilled my mission.&#8217; And all
the multitude answered, &#8216;Yea, verily hast thou&#8217;!&mdash;&#8216;O
Lord! I beseech Thee, bear Thou witness to it&#8217;! and, like
Moses, he lifted up his hands and blessed the people.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Three months more and Mo&#7717;ammad was dead.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">a.h.</span> 11. June, 632.
</p>

<hr />

<p>It is a hard thing to form a calm estimate of the
Dreamer of the Desert. There is something so tender and
womanly, and withal so heroic, about the man, that one
is in peril of finding the judgment unconsciously blinded
by the feeling of reverence and well-nigh love that such a
nature inspires. He who, standing alone, braved for years
the hatred of his people, is the same who was never the
first to withdraw his hand from another&#8217;s clasp, the beloved
of children, who never passed a group of little ones
without a smile from his wonderful eyes and a kind word
for them, sounding all the kinder in that sweet-toned
voice. The frank friendship, the noble generosity, the
dauntless courage and hope of the man, all tend to melt
criticism in admiration.</p>

<p>In telling in brief outline the story of Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s life
I have endeavoured to avoid controversial points. I have
tried to convey in the simplest manner the view of that
life which a study of the authorities must force upon
every unbiassed mind. Many of the events of Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s
life have been distorted and credited with ignoble
motives by European biographers; but on the facts they
mainly agree, and these I have narrated, without encumber
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxx" id="Page_lxx">[Pg&nbsp;lxx]</a></span>ing
them with the ingenious adumbrations of their learned
recorders. But there are some things in the Prophet&#8217;s life
which have given rise to charges too weighty to be dismissed
without discussion. He has been accused of
cruelty, sensuality, and insincerity; he has been called a
&#8216;bloodthirsty tyrant,&#8217; a voluptuary, and an impostor.</p>

<p>The charge of cruelty scarcely deserves consideration.
I have already spoken of the punishment of the Jews,
which forms the ground of the accusation. One has but
to refer to Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s conduct to the prisoners after
the battle of Bedr, to his patient tolerance towards his
enemies at Medina, his gentleness to his people, his love
of children and the dumb creatures, and above all, his
bloodless entry into Mekka, and the complete amnesty he
gave to those who had been his bitter enemies during
eighteen years of insult and persecution and finally open
war, to show that cruelty was no part of Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s
nature.</p>

<p>To say that Mo&#7717;ammad, or any other Arab, was sensual
in a higher degree than an ordinary European is simply to
enounce a well-worn axiom: the passions of the men of
the sunland are not as those of the chill north. But to
say that Mo&#7717;ammad was a voluptuary is false. The
simple austerity of his daily life, to the very last, his hard
mat for sleeping on, his plain food, his self-imposed menial
work, point him out as an ascetic rather than a voluptuary
in most senses of the word. Two things he loved, perfumes
and women; the first was harmless enough, and the special
case of his wives has its special answer. A great deal too
much has been said about these wives. It is a melancholy
spectacle to see professedly Christian biographers
gloating over the stories and fables of Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s domestic
relations like the writers and readers of &#8216;society&#8217;
journals. It is, of course, a fact that whilst the Prophet
allowed his followers only four wives he took more than
a dozen himself; but be it remembered that, with his unlimited
power, he need not have restricted himself to a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxi" id="Page_lxxi">[Pg&nbsp;lxxi]</a></span>
number insignificant compared with the &#7717;areems of some
of his successors, that he never divorced one of his wives,
that all of them save one were widows, and that one of
these widows was endowed with so terrific a temper that
Aboo-Bekr and &acute;Othm&aacute;n had already politely declined
the honour of her alliance before the Prophet married her:
the gratification of living with a vixen cannot surely be
excessive. Several of these marriages must have been entered
into from the feeling that those women whose husbands
had fallen in battle for the faith, and who had thus
been left unprotected, had a claim upon the generosity of
him who prompted the fight. Other marriages were contracted
from motives of policy, in order to conciliate the
heads of rival factions. It was not a high motive, but one
does not look for very romantic ideas about love-matches
from a man who regarded women as &#8216;crooked ribs,&#8217; and
whose system certainly does its best to make marriage
from love impossible; yet, on the other hand, it was not a
sensual motive. Perhaps the strongest reason&mdash;one of
which it is impossible to over-estimate the force&mdash;that
impelled Mo&#7717;ammad to take wife after wife was his desire
for male offspring. It was a natural wish that he should
have a son who should follow in his steps and carry on
his work; but the wish was never gratified, Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s
sons died young. After all, the overwhelming argument
is his fidelity to his first wife. When he was little more
than a boy he married Khadeejeh, who was fifteen years
older than himself, with all the added age that women
gain so quickly in the East. For five-and-twenty years
Mo&#7717;ammad remained faithful to his elderly wife, and when
she was sixty-five, and they might have celebrated their
&#8216;silver wedding,&#8217; he was as devoted to her as when first he
married her. During all those years there was never a
breath of scandal. Thus far Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s life will bear
microscopic scrutiny. Then Khadeejeh died; and though
he married many women afterwards, some of them rich in
youth and beauty, he never forgot his old wife, and loved
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxii" id="Page_lxxii">[Pg&nbsp;lxxii]</a></span>
her best to the end: &#8216;when I was poor she enriched me,
when they called me a liar she alone believed in me, when
all the world was against me she alone remained true.&#8217;
This loving, tender memory of an old wife laid in the
grave belongs only to a noble nature; it is not to be
looked for in a voluptuary.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>When, however, all has been said, when it has been
shown that Mo&#7717;ammad was not the rapacious voluptuary
some have taken him for, and that his violation of his own
marriage-law may be due to motives reasonable and just
from his point of view rather than to common sensuality,
there remains the fact that some of the soorahs of the
&#7730;ur-&aacute;n bear unmistakable marks of self-accommodation
and personal convenience; that Mo&#7717;ammad justified his
domestic excesses by words which he gave as from God.
And hence the third and gravest charge, the charge of
imposture. We must clearly understand what is meant
by this accusation. It is meant that the Prophet <i>consciously</i>
fabricated speeches, and palmed them off upon the
people as the very word of God. The question, it will at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxiii" id="Page_lxxiii">[Pg&nbsp;lxxiii]</a></span>
once be perceived, has nothing whatever to do with the
truth or untruth of the revelations. Many an earnest
enthusiast has uttered prophecies and exhortations which
he firmly believed to be the promptings of the Spirit, and
no man can charge such an one with imposture. He thoroughly
believes what he says, and the fault is in the
judgment, not the conscience. The question is clearly
narrowed to this: Did Mo&#7717;ammad believe he was speaking
the words of God equally when he declared that permission
was given him to take unto him more wives, as when
he proclaimed &#8216;There is no god but God&#8217;? It is a question
that concerns the conscience of man; and each must
answer it for himself. How far a man may be deluded
into believing everything he says is inspired it is impossible
to define. There are men to-day who would seem to
claim infallibility; and in Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s time it was so
much easier to believe in one&#8217;s self. Now, one never wants
a friend to remind him of his weakness; then, there were
hundreds who would fain have made the man think himself
God. It is wonderful, with his temptations, how
great a humility was ever his, how little he assumed
of all the god-like attributes men forced upon him.
His whole life is one long argument for his loyalty to
truth. He had but one answer for his worshippers,
&#8216;I am no more than a man, I am only human.&#8217; &#8216;Do
none enter Paradise save by the mercy of God?&#8217; asked
&acute;&Aacute;&iuml;sheh. &#8216;None, none, none,&#8217; he answered. &#8216;Not even
thou by thy own merits?&#8217; &#8216;Neither shall I enter
Paradise unless God cover me with His mercy.&#8217; He
was a man like unto his brethren in all things save one,
and that one difference served only to increase his
humbleness, and render him the more sensitive to his
shortcomings. He was sublimely confident of this single
attribute, that he was the messenger of the Lord of the
Daybreak, and that the words he spake came verily from
Him. He was fully persuaded&mdash;and no man dare dispute
his right to the belief&mdash;that God had sent him to do a

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxiv" id="Page_lxxiv">[Pg&nbsp;lxxiv]</a></span>
great work among his people in Arabia. Nervous to the
verge of madness, subject to hysteria, given to wild
dreamings in solitary places, his was a temperament that
easily leads itself to religious enthusiasm. He felt a
subtle influence within him which he believed to be the
movings of the Spirit: he thought he heard a voice; it
became real and audible to him, awed and terrified him,
so that he fell into frantic fits. Then he would arise and
utter some noble saying; and what wonder if he thought
it came straight from highest heaven? It was not without
a sore struggle that he convinced himself of his own
inspiration; but once admitted, the conviction grew with
his years and his widening influence for good, and nothing
then could shake his belief that he was the literal mouthpiece
of the All-Merciful. When a man has come to this
point, he cannot be expected to discriminate between this
saying and that. As the instrument of God he has lost
his individuality; he believes God is ever speaking through
his lips; he dare not question the inspiration of the
speech lest he should seem to doubt the Giver.</p>

<p>Yet there must surely be a limit to this delusion. There
are some passages in the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n which it is difficult to
think Mo&#7717;ammad truly believed to be the voice of the
Lord of the Worlds. Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s was a sensitive conscience
in the early years of his teaching, and it is hard
to think that it could have been so obscured in later
times that he could really believe in the inspired source
of some of his revelations. He may have thought the
commands they conveyed necessary, but he could hardly
have deemed them divine. In some cases he could scarcely
fail to be aware that the object of the &#8216;revelation&#8217; was his
own comfort or pleasure or reputation, and not the <i>major
Dei gloria</i>, nor the good of the people.</p>

<p>The truth would seem to be that in the latter part of
his life Mo&#7717;ammad was forced to enlarge the limits of his
revelations as the sphere of his influence increased. From
a private citizen of Mekka he had become the Emeer, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxv" id="Page_lxxv">[Pg&nbsp;lxxv]</a></span>
chief of the Arabs, the ruler of a factious, jealous, turbulent
people; and the change must have had its effect upon his
character. The man who from addressing a few devout
followers in a tent in the desert finds himself the head of
a nation of many tribes, king of a country twice the
size of France, will find many things difficult that before
seemed easy. As a statesman Mo&#7717;ammad was as great as
he was as a preacher of righteousness; but as his field of
work enlarged, his mind had to accommodate itself to the
needs of commoner minds. He learnt to see the expedient
where before he knew only the right. His revelations
now deal with the things of earth, when before they looked
only towards the things of heaven; and petty social rules,
&#8216;general orders,&#8217; selfish permissions, are promulgated with
the same authority and as from the same divine source as
the command to worship one God alone. He governed
the nation as a prophet and not as a king, and as a prophet
his ordinances must be endorsed with the divine
afflatus. He found he must regulate the meanest details
of the people&#8217;s life, and he believed he could only do this
by using God&#8217;s name for his decrees. He doubtless argued
himself into the belief that even these petty, and to us
sometimes immoral, regulations, being for the good of the
people, as he conceived the good, were really God&#8217;s ordinances;
but even thus he had lowered the standard of his
teaching, and alloyed with base metal the pure gold of his
early ideal. It was a temptation that few men have
withstood, but it was, nevertheless, a falling-off from the
Mo&#7717;ammad we loved at Mekka, the simple truth-loving
bearer of good tidings to the Arabs.</p>

<p>Yet behind this engrafted character, formed by the
difficulties of his position, by the invincible jealousy and
treachery of the tribes he governed, the old nature still
lived, and ever and anon broke forth in fervid words of
faith and hope in the cause and the promises that had
been the light and support of his early years of trial.
In the late chapters of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, among complicated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxvi" id="Page_lxxvi">[Pg&nbsp;lxxvi]</a></span>
directions for the Muslim&#8217;s guidance in all the circumstances
of life, we suddenly hear an echo of the old fiery
eloquence and the expression of the strong faith which
never deserted him.</p>

<p>Surely the character of Mo&#7717;ammad has been misjudged.
He was not the ambitious schemer some would have him,
still less the hypocrite and sham prophet others have imagined.
He was an enthusiast in that noblest sense when
enthusiasm becomes the salt of the earth, the one thing
that keeps men from rotting whilst they live. Enthusiasm
is often used despitefully, because it is joined
to an unworthy cause, or falls upon barren ground and
bears no fruit. So was it not with Mo&#7717;ammad. He
was an enthusiast when enthusiasm was the one thing
needed to set the world aflame, and his enthusiasm was
noble for a noble cause. He was one of those happy few
who have attained the supreme joy of making one great
truth their very life-spring. He was the messenger of the
One God, and never to his life&#8217;s end did he forget who he
was, or the message which was the marrow of his being.
He brought his tidings to his people with a grand dignity,
sprung from the consciousness of his high office, together
with a most sweet humility, whose roots lay in the knowledge
of his own weakness. Well did Carlyle choose him
for his prophet-hero! There have been purer lives and
higher aspirations than Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s; but no man was
ever more thoroughly filled with the sense of his mission
or carried out that mission more heroically.</p>

<h3>III.&mdash;ISLAM.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8216;Your turning your faces in prayer towards the east and the west is not piety;
but the pious is he who believeth in God and the Last Day, and in the Angels, and
the Scripture, and who giveth money, notwithstanding his love thereof, to relations
and orphans, and to the needy and the son of the road, and to the askers, and for
the freeing of slaves, and who performeth prayer and giveth the appointed alms; and
those who perform their covenant when they covenant, and the patient in adversity
and affliction and in the time of violence. These are they who have been true: and
these are they who fear God.&#8217;&mdash;<i>&#7730;ur-&aacute;n</i>, ii. 172.</p></div>

<p>When it was noised abroad that the Prophet was dead,
&acute;Omar, the fiery-hearted, the Simon Peter of Isl&aacute;m, rushed
among the people, and fiercely told them they lied, it could
not be true, Mo&#7717;ammad was not dead. And Aboo-Bekr
came and said, &#8216;Ye people! he that hath worshipped
Mo&#7717;ammad, let him know that Mo&#7717;ammad is dead; but
he that hath worshipped God,&mdash;that the Lord liveth, and
doth not die.&#8217;</p>

<p>Many have sought to answer the questions&mdash;Why was
the triumph of Isl&aacute;m so speedy and so complete? Why
have so many millions embraced the religion of Mo&#7717;ammad,
and scarcely a hundred ever recanted? Why do a
thousand Christians become Muslims to one Muslim who
adopts Christianity? Why do a hundred and fifty millions
of human beings still cling to the faith of Isl&aacute;m?
Some have attempted to explain the first overwhelming
success of the Mo&#7717;ammadan religion by the argument of
the sword. They forget Carlyle&#8217;s laconic reply, &#8216;First get
your sword.&#8217; You must win men&#8217;s hearts before you can
induce them to peril their lives for you, and the first conquerors
of Isl&aacute;m must have been made Muslims before
they were made &#8216;fighters on the path of God.&#8217; Others
allege the low morality of the religion and the sensual
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxviii" id="Page_lxxviii">[Pg&nbsp;lxxviii]</a></span>
paradise it promises as a sufficient cause for the zeal of its
followers; but even were these admitted to the full, to say
that such reasons could win the hearts of millions of men
who have the same hopes and longings after the right and
the noble as we, is to libel mankind. No religion has ever
gained a lasting hold upon the souls of men by the force
of its sensual permissions and fleshly promises. It is
urged, again, that Isl&aacute;m met no fair foe, that the worn-out
forms of Christianity and Judaism it encountered were
no test of its power as a quickening faith, and that it prevailed
simply because there was nothing to prevent it;
and this was undoubtedly a help to the progress of the
new creed, but it could not have been the cause of its
victory.</p>

<p>In all these reasons the religion itself is left out of the
question. Decidedly Isl&aacute;m itself was the main cause of
its triumph. By some strange intuition Mo&#7717;ammad succeeded
in finding the one form of Monotheism that has
ever commended itself to any wide section of the Eastern
world. It was only a remnant of the Jews that learned
to worship the one God of the prophets after the hard
lessons of the Captivity. Christianity has never gained a
hold upon the East. Isl&aacute;m not only was at once accepted
(partly in earnest, partly in name, but accepted) by Arabia,
Syria, Persia, Egypt, Northern Africa, and Southern Spain
at its first outburst, but, with the exception of Spain, it
has never lost its vantage-ground; it has seen no country
that has once embraced its doctrine turn to another faith;
it has added great multitudes in India and China and
Turkestan to its subjects; and in quite recent times it has
been spreading in wide and swiftly&mdash;following waves over
Africa, and has left but a small part of that vast continent
unconverted to its creed. Admitting the mixed causes
that contributed to the rapidity of the first torrent of
Mo&#7717;ammadan conquest, they do not account for the
duration of Isl&aacute;m. There must be something in the religion
itself to explain its persistence and increase, and to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxix" id="Page_lxxix">[Pg&nbsp;lxxix]</a></span>
account for its present hold over so large a proportion of
the dwellers on the earth.</p>

<p>Men trained in European ideas of religion have always
found a difficulty in understanding the fascination which
the Muslim faith has for so many minds in the East.
&#8216;There is no god but God, and Mo&#7717;ammad is His Prophet.&#8217;
There is nothing in this, they say, to move the heart. Yet
this creed has stirred an enthusiasm that has never been
surpassed. Isl&aacute;m has had its martyrs, its self-tormentors,
its recluses, who have renounced all that life offered and
have accepted death with a smile for the sake of the faith
that was in them. It is idle to say the eternity of happiness
will explain this. The truest martyrs of Isl&aacute;m, as
well as of Christianity, did not die to gain paradise. And
if they did, the belief in the promises of the creed must
follow the hearty belief in the creed. Isl&aacute;m must have
possessed a power of seizing men&#8217;s belief before it could
have inspired them with such a love of its paradise.</p>

<p>Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s conception of God has, I think, been misunderstood,
and its effect upon the people consequently
under-estimated. The God of Isl&aacute;m is commonly represented
as a pitiless tyrant, who plays with humanity as
on a chessboard, and works out his game without regard
to the sacrifice of the pieces; and there is a certain truth
in the figure. There is more in Isl&aacute;m of the potter who
shapes the clay than of the father pitying his children.
Mo&#7717;ammad conceived of God as the Semitic mind has
always preferred to think of Him: his God is the All-Mighty,
the All-Knowing, the All-Just. Irresistible
Power is the first attribute he thinks of: the Lord of the
Worlds, the Author of the Heavens and the Earth, who
hath created Life and Death, in whose hand is Dominion,
who maketh the Dawn to appear and causeth the Night
to cover the Day, the Great, All-Powerful Lord of the
glorious Throne; the Thunder proclaimeth His perfection,
the whole earth is His handful, and the Heavens shall be
folded together in His right hand. And with the Power
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxx" id="Page_lxxx">[Pg&nbsp;lxxx]</a></span>
He conceives the Knowledge that directs it to right ends.
God is the Wise, the Just, the True, the Swift in reckoning,
who knoweth every ant&#8217;s weight of good and of ill
that each man hath done, and who suffereth not the reward
of the faithful to perish.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8216;God! There is no God but He, the Ever-Living, the Ever-Subsisting.
Slumber seizeth Him not nor sleep. To Him belongeth
whatsoever is in the Heavens and whatsoever is in the Earth. Who
is he that shall intercede with Him, save by His permission? He
knoweth the things that have gone before and the things that follow
after, and men shall not compass aught of His knowledge, save what
He willeth. His Throne comprehendeth the Heavens and the Earth,
and the care of them burdeneth Him not. And He is the High, the
Great.&#8217;&mdash;<i>&#7730;ur-&aacute;n</i>, ii. 256.</p></div>

<p>But with this Power there is also the gentleness that
belongs only to great strength. God is the Guardian over
His servants, the Shelterer of the orphan, the Guider of the
erring, the Deliverer from every affliction; in His hand is
Good, and He is the Generous Lord, the Gracious, the
Hearer, the Near-at-Hand. Every soorah of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n
begins with the words, &#8216;In the Name of God, the Compassionate,
the Merciful,&#8217; and Mo&#7717;ammad was never tired
of telling the people how God was Very-Forgiving, that
His love for man was more tender than the mother-bird
for her young.</p>

<p>It is too often forgotten how much there is in the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n
of the loving-kindness of God, but it must be allowed
that these are not the main thoughts in Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s
teaching. It is the doctrine of the Might of God that
most held his imagination, and that has impressed itself
most strongly upon Muslims of all ages. The fear rather
than the love of God is the spur of Isl&aacute;m. There can be
no question which is the higher incentive to good; but
it is nearly certain that the love of God is an idea absolutely
foreign to most of the races that have accepted
Isl&aacute;m, and to preach such a doctrine would have been to
mistake the leaning of the Semitic mind.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxi" id="Page_lxxxi">[Pg&nbsp;lxxxi]</a></span></p>

<p>The leading doctrine of Mo&#7717;ammad, then, is the belief
in One All-Powerful God. Isl&aacute;m is the self-surrender of
every man to the will of God. Its danger lies in the
stress laid on the power of God, which has brought about
the stifling effects of fatalism. Mo&#7717;ammad taught the
foreknowledge of God, but he did not lay down precisely
the doctrine of Predestination. He found it, as all have
found it, a stumbling-block in the way of man&#8217;s progress.
It perplexed him, and he spoke of it, but often contradicted
himself; and he would become angry if the subject
were mooted in his presence: &#8216;Sit not with a disputer
about fate,&#8217; he said, &#8216;nor begin a conversation with him.&#8217;
Mo&#7717;ammad vaguely recognised that little margin of Free
Will which makes life not wholly mechanical.</p>

<p>This doctrine of one Supreme God, to whose will it is
the duty of every man to surrender himself, is the kernel
of Isl&aacute;m, the truth for which Mo&#7717;ammad lived and suffered
and triumphed. But it was no new teaching, as he
himself was constantly saying. His was only the last
of revelations. Many prophets&mdash;Abraham, Moses, and
Christ&mdash;had taught the same faith before; but people
had hearkened little to their words. So Mo&#7717;ammad was
sent, not different from them, only a messenger, yet the
last and greatest of them, the &#8216;seal of prophecy,&#8217; the &#8216;most
excellent of the creation of God.&#8217; This is the second
dogma of Isl&aacute;m: Mo&#7717;ammad is the apostle of God. It
is well worthy of notice that it is not said, &#8216;Mo&#7717;ammad is
the only apostle of God.&#8217; Isl&aacute;m is more tolerant in this
matter than other religions. Its prophet is not the sole
commissioner of the Most High, nor is his teaching
the only true teaching the world has ever received.
Many other messengers had been sent by God to guide
men to the right, and these taught the same religion
that was in the mouth of the preacher of Isl&aacute;m.
Hence Muslims reverence Moses and Christ only next
to Mo&#7717;ammad. All they claim for their founder is that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxii" id="Page_lxxxii">[Pg&nbsp;lxxxii]</a></span>
he was the last and best of the messengers of the one
God.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>After the belief in God and his prophets and scriptures,
the Muslim must believe in angels, good and evil genii,
in the resurrection and the judgment, and in future
rewards and punishments. What the teaching of the
&#7730;ur-&aacute;n is upon these points may be seen in the First Part
of the &#8216;Selections.&#8217; They form a very common weapon of
attack on the ground of their superstition, their anthropomorphism,
and their sensuality. Yet these minor
beliefs have their place in all religions, and they are conceived
in scarcely more absurdly realistic a manner in
Isl&aacute;m than in any other creed. Every religion seems to
need an improbable, almost a ludicrous, side, in order to
provide material for the faith of the masses. Mo&#7717;ammad
himself was what is called a superstitious man, and the
improbable side thus found its way easily into his creed.
With all the fancies floating in Arabia in his time, it
would have been strange if he had introduced nothing of
the superstitious into Isl&aacute;m. The Jinn, the Afreets, and
the other beings of the air and water, have not done
much harm to the Mohammadan mind; and they have
given so many a delightful fable to the West, that we
must feel a certain grateful respect for them. The realistic
pictures of paradise and hell have exercised a more serious
influence. The minute details of these infernal and celestial
pictures must move alternately the disgust and the
contemptuous amusement of a Western reader; yet these
same things were very real facts to Mo&#7717;ammad, and have
been of the utmost importance to generation after generation
of Muslims. In the present day there are cultured
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxiii" id="Page_lxxxiii">[Pg&nbsp;lxxxiii]</a></span>
men who receive these descriptions in the same allegorical
sense as some Christians accept the Revelation of S. John&mdash;which,
indeed, in some respects offers a close parallel to
the pictorial parts of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n; but the vast majority of
believers (like many Christians in the parallel case) take
the descriptions literally, and there can be no doubt that
the belief founded on such pictures, accepted literally, must
work an ill effect on the professors of the faith of which
these doctrines form a minor, but a too prominent, part;
and it is the aim of rational Muslims to sweep away such
cobwebs from their sky.</p>

<p>Isl&aacute;m lies more in doing than in believing. That &#8216;faith
without works is dead&#8217; is a doctrine which every day&#8217;s
routine must bring home to the mind of the devout Muslim.
The practical duties of the Mohammadan religion,
beyond the actual profession of faith, are the performance
of prayer, the giving of alms, the keeping of the fasts,
and the accomplishing the pilgrimage. Mr. Lane has so
minutely described the regular prayers used over all the
Mohammadan East, that it is only necessary here to refer
to his account of them in the &#8216;Modern Egyptians.&#8217; There
it will be seen that they form no light part of the religious
duties of the Muslim, especially since they involve
careful preparatory ablutions; for Mo&#7717;ammad impressed
upon his followers the salutary doctrine that cleanliness is
an essential part of godliness, and the scrupulous cleanliness
of the Mohammadan, which contrasts so favourably
with the unsavoury state of Easterns of other creeds, is an
excellent feature in the practical influence of Isl&aacute;m. The
charge which missionaries and the like are fond of bringing
against the Muslim prayers, that they are merely
lifeless forms and vain repetitions, is an exaggeration.
There is a vast deal of repetition in the Mohammadan
ritual, just as the paternoster is repeated again and again
in the principal Christian liturgies; but iteration does not
necessarily kill devotion. There is plenty of real fervour
in the prayers of the Mosque, and they are joined-in by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxiv" id="Page_lxxxiv">[Pg&nbsp;lxxxiv]</a></span>
the worshippers with an earnest attention which shames
the listless sleepy bearing of most congregations in England.
It is true the greater part of the prayers are laid
down in prescribed forms; but there is an interval set
apart for private supplication, and the original congregations
in the mosques availed themselves of this permission
more generally than is now the case, when the old fervour
has become comparatively cool; and Mo&#7717;ammad frequently
enjoins private prayer at home, and specially praises him
who &#8216;passeth his night worshipping God.&#8217;</p>

<p>Almsgiving was originally compulsory, and the tax was
collected by the officers of the Khalif; but now the Muslim
is merely expected to give voluntarily about a fortieth
part of his income in charity each year. The great fast of
Rama&#7693;&aacute;n is too well known to need more than a passing
mention here; but it is not so well known that Mo&#7717;ammad,
ascetic as he was himself in this as in many other
matters, whilst he ordained the month of fasting for the
chastening of his able-bodied followers, was a determined
enemy to useless mortification of the flesh, and boldly
affirmed that God took no pleasure in a man&#8217;s wantonly
injuring himself; and so if one that was weakly and sick
could not keep the fast without bodily detriment he was
to omit it. And the same wise leniency was shown by
the Arab prophet in respect of prayer,&mdash;which may be
curtailed or omitted in certain cases,&mdash;and with regard to
the pilgrimage, which no one was to perform to his hurt.
This same pilgrimage is often urged as a sign of Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s
tendency to superstition and even idolatry. It is
asked how the destroyer of idols could have reconciled his
conscience to the circuits of the Ka&#7841;beh and the veneration
of the black stone covered with adoring kisses.
The rites of the pilgrimage cannot certainly be defended
against the charge of superstition; but it is easy to see
why Mo&#7717;ammad enjoined them. They were hallowed to
him by the memories of his ancestors, who had been the
guardians of the sacred temple, and by the traditional
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxv" id="Page_lxxxv">[Pg&nbsp;lxxxv]</a></span>
reverence of all his people; and besides this tie of association,
which in itself was enough to make it impossible for
him to do away with the rites, Mo&#7717;ammad perceived
that the worship in the Ka&#7841;beh would prove of real
value to his religion. He swept away the more idolatrous
and immoral part of the ceremonies, but he retained the
pilgrimage to Mekka and the old veneration of the temple
for reasons of which it is impossible to dispute the wisdom.
He well knew the consolidating effect of forming a centre
to which his followers should gather; and hence he reasserted
the sanctity of the black stone that &#8216;came down
from Heaven;&#8217; he ordained that everywhere throughout
the world the Muslim should pray looking towards the
Ka&#7841;beh, and he enjoined him to make the pilgrimage
thither. Mekka is to the Muslim what Jerusalem is to
the Jew. It bears with it all the influence of centuries
of associations. It carries the Muslim back to the cradle
of his faith, the childhood of his prophet; it reminds him
of the struggle between the old faith and the new, of the
overthrow of the idols, and the establishment of the
worship of the One God. And, most of all, it bids him
remember that all his brother Muslims are worshipping
towards the same sacred spot; that he is one of a great
company of believers, united by one faith, filled with the
same hopes, reverencing the same things, worshipping the
same God. Mo&#7717;ammad showed his knowledge of the
religious emotions in man when he preserved the sanctity
of the temple of Isl&aacute;m.</p>

<p>It would take too much space to look closely into the
lesser duties of Isl&aacute;m, many of which suggest exceedingly
wholesome lessons to Western civilisation. But we must
not pass over one of these minor duties, for it reflects
the highest credit upon the founder and the professors
of Mohammadanism&mdash;I mean the humane treatment of
animals.</p>

<p>&#8216;There is no religion which has taken a higher view
in its authoritative documents of animal life, and none
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxvi" id="Page_lxxxvi">[Pg&nbsp;lxxxvi]</a></span>
wherein the precept has been so much honoured by its
practical observance. &#8216;There is no beast on earth,&#8217; says
the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, &#8216;nor bird which flieth with its wings, but the
same is a people like unto you&mdash;unto the Lord shall they
return;&#8217; and it is the current belief that animals will share
with men the general resurrection, and be judged according
to their works. At the slaughter of an animal, the
Prophet ordered that the name of God should always be
named; but the words, &#8216;the Compassionate, the Merciful,&#8217;
were to be omitted; for, on the one hand, such an expression
seemed a mockery to the sufferer, and, on the other,
he could not bring himself to believe that the destruction
of any life, however necessary, could be altogether pleasing
to the All-Merciful. &#8216;In the name of God,&#8217; says a pious
Musalman before he strikes the fatal blow; &#8216;God is most
great; God give thee patience to endure the affliction
which He hath allotted thee!&#8217; In the East there has
been no moralist like Bentham to insist in noble words on
the extension of the sphere of morality to all sentient
beings, and to be ridiculed for it by people who call themselves
religious; there has been no naturalist like Darwin,
to demonstrate by his marvellous powers of observation
how large a part of the mental and moral faculties which
we usually claim for ourselves alone we share with other
beings; there has been no Oriental &#8216;Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals.&#8217; But one reason of this
is not far to seek. What the legislation of the last few
years has at length attempted to do, and, from the mere
fact that it is legislation, must do ineffectually, has been
long effected in the East by the moral and religious sentiment
which, like almost everything that is good in that part
of the world, can be traced back, in part at least, to the great
Prophet of Arabia. In the East, so far as it has not been hardened
by the West, there is a real sympathy between man
and the domestic animals; they understand one another;
and the cruelties which the most humane of our countrymen
unconsciously effect in the habitual use, for instance,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxvii" id="Page_lxxxvii">[Pg&nbsp;lxxxvii]</a></span>
of the muzzle or the bearing-rein on the most docile, the
most patient, the most faithful, and the most intelligent
of their companions, are impossible in the East. An Arab
<i>cannot</i> ill-treat his horse; and Mr. Lane bears emphatic
testimony to the fact that in his long residence in Egypt
he never saw an ass or a dog (though the latter is there
looked upon as an unclean animal) treated with cruelty,
except in those cities which were overrun by Europeans.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>There are some very beautiful traditions of the Prophet,
showing the tenderness with which he always treated animals
and which he ever enjoined on his people. A man
once came to him with a carpet and said, &#8216;O Prophet, I
passed through a wood and heard the voices of the young of
birds, and I took and put them into my carpet, and their
mother came fluttering round my head.&#8217; And the Prophet
said, &#8216;Put them down;&#8217; and when he had put them down
the mother joined the young. And the Prophet said, &#8216;Do
you wonder at the affection of the mother towards her
young? I swear by Him who has sent me, Verily God is
more loving to his servants than the mother to these
young birds. Return them to the place from which ye
took them, and let their mother be with them.&#8217; &#8216;Fear
God with regard to animals,&#8217; said Mo&#7717;ammad; &#8216;ride them
when they are fit to be ridden, and get off when they are
tired. Verily there are rewards for our doing good to
dumb animals, and giving them water to drink.&#8217;<br /><br /></p>

<p>Such, in brief outline, is the religion of Mo&#7717;ammad.
It is a form of pure theism, simpler and more austere
than the theism of most forms of modern Christianity,
lofty in its conception of the relation of man to God, and
noble in its doctrine of the duty of man to man, and of
man to the lower creation. There is little in it of superstition,
less of complexity of dogmas; it is an exacting
religion, without the repulsiveness of asceticism; severe,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxviii" id="Page_lxxxviii">[Pg&nbsp;lxxxviii]</a></span>
but not merciless. On the other hand, it is over-rigid
and formal; it leaves too little to the believer and too
much to his ritual; it places a prophet and a book between
man and God, and practically discourages the desire
for a direct relation between the Deity and his servant;
it draws the picture of that God in too harsh outlines,
and leaves out too much of the tenderness and loving-kindness
of the God of Christ&#8217;s teaching, and hence it has
been the source of more intolerance and fanatical hatred
than most creeds.</p>

<p>This religion is Isl&aacute;m as understood and taught by its
Prophet, so far as we can gather it from the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, aided
by those traditions which seem to have the stamp of
authenticity. It need hardly be said that it is not identical
with the Isl&aacute;m with which the philosophers of Baghd&aacute;d
amused themselves, nor with the fantastic creed
which the F&aacute;&#7789;imee Khalifs of Egypt represented, and
brought in the person of El-&#7716;&aacute;kim to its limit of extravagance;
nor is it the Isl&aacute;m with which as much as with
their ferocity the Karma&#7789;ees aroused the fear and abhorrence
of all good Muslims. Neither the Soofism of
Persia nor the dervish sensation-religion of Turkey conform
to this ancient Isl&aacute;m, to which perhaps a modification
of the Wa&#7717;&#7717;&aacute;bee puritanism would be the nearest
approach. The original faith of Mo&#7717;ammad has not gained
by its development in foreign lands and alien minds, and
perhaps the best we can hope for modern Isl&aacute;m is that
it may try the experiment of retrogression, or rather seek
to regain the simplicity of the old form without losing the
advantages (if there be any) which it has acquired from
contact with Western civilisation.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Isl&aacute;m is unfortunately a social system as well as a
religion; and herein lies the great difficulty of fairly estimating
its good and its bad influence on the world. It is
but in the nature of things that the teacher who lays down
the law of the relation of man to God should also endeavour
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_lxxxix" id="Page_lxxxix">[Pg&nbsp;lxxxix]</a></span>
to appoint the proper relation between man and his
neighbour. Christianity was undoubtedly a social even
more than a religious reform, but the social regulations
were too indefinite, or at all events too impracticable, for
any wide acceptance among the professors of the religion.
Isl&aacute;m was less fortunate. Mo&#7717;ammad not only
promulgated a religion; he laid down a complete social
system, containing minute regulations for a man&#8217;s conduct
in all circumstances of life, with due rewards or penalties
according to his fulfilment of these rules. As a religion
Isl&aacute;m is great: it has taught men to worship one God
with a pure worship who formerly worshipped many gods
impurely. As a social system Isl&aacute;m is a complete failure:
it has misunderstood the relations of the sexes, upon
which the whole character of a nation&#8217;s life hangs, and,
by degrading women, has degraded each successive generation
of their children down an increasing scale of infamy
and corruption, until it seems almost impossible to reach
a lower level of vice.</p>

<p>The fatal spot in Isl&aacute;m is the degradation of women.
The true test of a nation&#8217;s place in the ranks of civilisation
is the position of its women. When they are held
in reverence, when it is considered the most infamous of
crimes to subject a woman to dishonour, and the highest
distinction to protect her from wrong; when the family
life is real and strong, of which the mother-wife is the
heart; when each man&#8217;s pulse beats loyal to womanhood,
then is a nation great. When women are treated
as playthings, toys, drudges, worth anything only if
they have beauty to be enjoyed or strength to labour;
when sex is considered the chief thing in a woman, and
heart and mind are forgotten; when a man buys women
for his pleasure and dismisses them when his appetite is
glutted, then is a nation despicable.</p>

<p>And so is it in the East. Yet it would be hard to lay
the blame altogether on Mo&#7717;ammad. The real roots of the
degradation of women lie much deeper. When Isl&aacute;m was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xc" id="Page_xc">[Pg&nbsp;xc]</a></span>
instituted, polygamy was almost necessitated by the number
of women and their need of support; and the facility
of divorce was quite necessitated by the separation of the
sexes, and the consequence that a man could not know or
even see the woman he was about to marry before the marriage
ceremony was accomplished. It is not Mo&#7717;ammad
whom we must blame for these great evils, polygamy and
divorce; it is the state of society which demanded the
separation of the sexes, and in which it was not safe to
allow men and women freely to associate; in other words,
it was the sensual constitution of the Arab that lay at the
root of the matter. Mo&#7717;ammad might have done better.
He might boldly have swept away the traditions of Arab
society, unveiled the women, intermingled the sexes, and
punished by the most severe measures any license which
such association might at first encourage. With his boundless
influence, it is possible that he might have done this,
and, the new system once fairly settled, and the people
accustomed to it, the good effects of the change would have
begun to show themselves. But such an idea could never
have occurred to him. We must always remember that
we are dealing with a social system of the seventh century,
not of the nineteenth. Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s ideas about women
were like those of the rest of his contemporaries. He
looked upon them as charming snares to the believer,
ornamental articles of furniture difficult to keep in order,
pretty playthings; but that a woman should be the counsellor
and companion of a man does not seem to have occurred
to him. It is to be wondered that the feeling of respect he
always entertained for his first wife, Khadeejeh, (which,
however, is partly accounted for by the fact that she was
old enough to have been his mother,) found no counterpart
in his general opinion of womankind: &#8216;Woman was made
from a crooked rib, and if you try to bend it straight, it
will break; therefore treat your wives kindly.&#8217; Mo&#7717;ammad
was not the man to make a social reform affecting women,
nor was Arabia the country in which such a change should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xci" id="Page_xci">[Pg&nbsp;xci]</a></span>
be made, nor Arab ladies perhaps the best subjects for the
experiment. Still he did something towards bettering the
condition of women: he limited the number of wives to
four; laid his hand with the utmost severity on the incestuous
marriages that were then rife in Arabia; compelled
husbands to support their divorced wives during
their four months of probation; made irrevocable divorce
less common by adding the rough, but deterring, condition
that a woman triply divorced could not return
to her husband without first being married to some one
else&mdash;a condition exceedingly disagreeable to the first husband;
and required four witnesses to prove a charge of
adultery against a wife&mdash;a merciful provision, difficult to
be fulfilled. The evil permitted by Mo&#7717;ammad in leaving
the number of wives four instead of insisting on monogamy
was not great. Without considering the sacrifice of family
peace which the possession of a large harem entails, the
expense of keeping several wives, each of whom must have
a separate suite of apartments or a separate house, is so
great that not more than one in twenty can afford it. It
is not so much in the matter of wives as in that of concubines
that Mo&#7717;ammad made an irretrievable mistake.
The condition of the female slave in the East is indeed
deplorable. She is at the entire mercy of her master, who
can do what he pleases with her and her companions; for
the Muslim is not restricted in the number of his concubines,
as he is in that of his wives. The female white slave
is kept solely for the master&#8217;s sensual gratification, and is
sold when he is tired of her, and so she passes from master
to master, a very wreck of womanhood. Her condition is
a little improved if she bear a son to her tyrant; but even
then he is at liberty to refuse to acknowledge the child as
his own, though it must be owned he seldom does this.
Kind as the Prophet was himself towards bondswomen,
one cannot forget the unutterable brutalities which he
suffered his followers to inflict upon conquered nations in
the taking of slaves. The Muslim soldier was allowed to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcii" id="Page_xcii">[Pg&nbsp;xcii]</a></span>
do as he pleased with any &#8216;infidel&#8217; woman he might
meet with on his victorious march. When one thinks of
the thousands of women, mothers and daughters, who
must have suffered untold shame and dishonour by this
license, he cannot find words to express his horror. And
this cruel indulgence has left its mark on the Muslim
character, nay, on the whole character of Eastern life.
Now, as at the first, young Christian girls are dragged
away from their homes and given over to the unhallowed
lusts of a Turkish voluptuary; and not only to Turks, but
to Englishmen; for the contagion has spread, and Englishmen,
even those who by their sacred order should know
better, instead of uttering their protest, as men of honour
and Christians, against the degradation, have followed the
example of the Turk, and helped in the ruin of women.
Concubinage is the black stain in Isl&aacute;m. With Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s
views of women, we could hardly expect him to do
better; but, on the other hand, he could scarcely have
done worse. There are, however, one or two alleviating
circumstances. One is the fact that the canker has not
eaten into the whole of Eastern society; it is chiefly
among the rich that the evil effects of the system are felt.
And another fact which shows that the Mohammadan
system, bad as it is, is free from a defect which social
systems better in other respects than Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s are
subject to is the extreme rarity of prostitution in Muslim
towns. The courtesan forms a very small item in the
census of a Mohammadan city, and is retained more for
strangers from Europe than for the Muslim inhabitants.
Instances are frequently occurring in the Indian law courts
which show the strong feeling that exists on the subject
among the Mohammadans of India. They consider it
quite inconceivable that a Muslim should have illicit
intercourse with a free Muslimeh woman, and this inconceivableness
of the action is urged as evidence in trials
of the legitimacy of children. But whilst admitting the
importance of this remarkable feature in Isl&aacute;m, it must
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xciii" id="Page_xciii">[Pg&nbsp;xciii]</a></span>
not be forgotten that the liberty allowed by their law
to Muslims in the matter of concubines does not very
materially differ from prostitution, and whilst the latter
is directly forbidden by the dominant religion of Europe,
concubinage is as directly permitted by Isl&aacute;m.</p>

<p>One would think that long intercourse with Europeans
might have somewhat raised the estimation of women in
the East; but either because travellers in the East are not
always the best specimens of Western morality, or because
the Eastern mind has an unequalled aptitude for assimilating
the bad and rejecting the good in any system it meets,
it is certain that women are no better off now than they
were in the East. A well-known correspondent of a leading
daily print writes thus of Turkish home life:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8216;It is obvious that the home life of any people will depend almost
entirely on the position which is assigned to women. It is not
necessary to inquire what this position is according to the teaching
of the sacred books of a race. Between Christianity and Isl&aacute;m it
is enough to notice that there is apparently no country where the
first is the prevailing religion in which woman is hindered by
religion from obtaining a position almost, if not quite, on an equality
with man, and similarly, no country where the second prevails
where woman is not in a degraded position.... Under Christianity
she is everywhere free. Under Isl&aacute;m she is everywhere a slave.
The pious Mohammadan, like the pious Jew, thanks God that he
has not been made a woman. The pious Mohammadan woman,
like the pious Jewess, thanks God that she has been made according
to the Creator&#8217;s will. Man and woman alike recognise that to
be a woman is to be in an inferior condition. This feeling of the
degradation of woman so pervades Turkey that the poorer classes of
Christians have even become infected by it. When a son is born
there is nothing but congratulations. When a daughter, nothing
but condolences. A polite Turk, if he has occasion to mention his
wife, will do so with an apology.... He regards it as a piece of
rudeness to mention the fact to you, and it would be equally rude
for him to inquire after your wife, or to hint that he knew you were
guilty of anything so unmentionable as to have one. Charles the
Twelfth told his queen that she had been chosen to give children,
and not advice. The Turk regards woman as destined solely for the
same purpose and for his pleasure. Probably polygamy is of itself
sufficient to account for the way in which Mohammadans regard
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xciv" id="Page_xciv">[Pg&nbsp;xciv]</a></span>
woman. But whether this is so or not, there is one influence which
polygamy asserts which accounts for the low ideal of woman prevalent
in all Muslim countries. When a man has a number of wives
it is impossible that they can all become his companions and his
confidantes, or that one of them can become his companion or confidante
to the same extent as if the man had only one wife. Hence
a man who is limited to one will not be contented with beauty
alone. He must have a certain amount of intelligence and education.
The Turk, on the other hand, has no reason whatever to think of
anything except beauty. As he never means to see much of his
wife, intelligence or education is a matter of small account. If he
can afford it he will have a Circassian wife, a woman who has been
reared with the intention of being sold, who has not an idea in her
head, who has seen nothing, and knows nothing. Such a woman
would be as objectionable as a wife to the great majority of Europeans
as a South Sea Island beauty. But she satisfies the ideal of
the Turk. She is beautiful, and beauty is all that he requires.&#8217;</p></div>

<p>It is this sensual and degraded view of woman that
destroys to so great an extent the good influence which
the better part of the teaching of Isl&aacute;m might exert in the
East. So long as women are held in so light an esteem,
they will remain ignorant, and bigoted, and sensual; and
so long as mothers are what most Muslim mothers are now,
their children will be ignorant and fanatical and vicious.
In Turkey there are other influences at work besides the
Mohammadan social system; but Turkish women may
serve as an instance of the state of things which that
system encourages. &#8216;In those early years spent at home,
when the child ought to have instilled into him some
germ of those principles of conduct by which men must
walk in the world if they are to hold up their heads
among civilised nations, the Turkish child is only taught
the first steps towards those vicious habits of mind and
body which have made his race what it is. The root of
the evil is partly found in the harem system. So long as
that system keeps Turkish women in their present depressed
state, so long will Turkish boys and girls be vicious
and ignorant.&#8217; As I have said elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> &#8216;It is quite
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcv" id="Page_xcv">[Pg&nbsp;xcv]</a></span>
certain that there is no hope for the Turks so long as
Turkish women remain what they are, and home-training
is the initiation of vice.&#8217; If the mother is ignorant and
vicious, the son cannot form a high ideal of womanhood,
and thus is barred off from the chivalrous spirit wherewith
alone a man may reach to the highest love:&mdash;that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line i4">&#8216;Subtle master under heaven,</div>
<div class="line">Not only to keep down the base in man,</div>
<div class="line">But teach high thought, and amiable words,</div>
<div class="line">And courtliness, and the desire of fame,</div>
<div class="line">And love of truth, and all that makes a man.&#8217;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Muslin has no ideal of chivalry like this to make
his life pure and honourable: his religion encourages an
opposite view, and the women among whom he is brought
up only confirm it.</p>

<p>If Isl&aacute;m is to be a power for good in the future, it is
imperatively necessary to cut off the social system from
the religion. At the beginning, among a people who had
advanced but a little way on the road of civilisation, the
defects of the social system were not so apparent; but
now, when Easterns are endeavouring to mix on equal
terms with Europeans, and are trying to adopt the manners
and customs of the West, it is clear that the condition of
their women must be radically changed if any good is to
come of the Europeanising tendency. The difficulty lies
in the close connection between the religious and social
ordinances in the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n: the two are so intermingled that
it is hard to see how they can be disentangled without
destroying both. The theory of revelation would have
to be modified. Muslims would have to give up their
doctrine of the syllabic inspiration of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n and exercise
their moral sense in distinguishing between the particular
and the general, the temporary and the permanent:
they would have to recognise that there was much in
Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s teaching which, though useful at the time, is
inapplicable to the present conditions of life; that his
knowledge was often partial, and his judgment sometimes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcvi" id="Page_xcvi">[Pg&nbsp;xcvi]</a></span>
at fault; that the moral sense is capable of education as
much as the intellect, and, therefore, that what was apparently
moral and wise in the seventh century may quite
possibly be immoral and suicidal in a society of the nineteenth
century. Mo&#7717;ammad himself said, according to
tradition, &#8216;I am no more than a man: when I order you
anything respecting religion, receive it; and when I order
you about the affairs of the world, then I am nothing more
than man.&#8217; And he seemed to foresee that the time
would come when his minor regulations would call for
revision: &#8216;Ye are in an age,&#8217; he said, &#8216;in which, if ye
abandon one-tenth of what is ordered, ye will be ruined.
After this, a time will come when he who shall observe
one-tenth of what is now ordered will be redeemed.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>If Muslims would take these warnings of their prophet
to heart, there would be some hope for Isl&aacute;m. Some few
of the higher intellects among them have already admitted
the principle of moral criticism applied to the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n;
but it is very doubtful whether &#8216;rational Isl&aacute;m&#8217; will ever
gain a wide following, any more than &#8216;rational Christianity.&#8217;
People in general do not care to think for themselves
in matters religious. They like their creed served
up to them as cooked meat, not raw flesh. They must
have definite texts and hard-and-fast commandments to
appeal to. They will not believe in the spirit, but prefer
the letter. They will have nothing to say to tendencies,
but must have facts. It is of no avail to speak to them
of the spirit of a life or of a whole book; they must hang
their doctrine on a solitary sentence. They will either
believe every letter of their scripture, or they will believe
nothing.</p>

<p>Such people make up the majority of the professors of
Isl&aacute;m; and with them no reform, within Isl&aacute;m, seems
possible. Among the upper (I will not call them the
higher) classes, they are either fanatics or concealed infidels;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcvii" id="Page_xcvii">[Pg&nbsp;xcvii]</a></span>
and their lives are a proof of the incompatibility of
ordinary Mohammadanism, real or nominal, with a high
social and national life. Among the poorer classes, the
social system has a more restricted field of operation, for
the poor are naturally less able to avail themselves of the
permissions of their Prophet. In a poor community Isl&aacute;m
exerts an eminently salutary influence, as the condition of
the Mohammadan converts in Western Africa conclusively
proves. An able observer,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> whose African birth and training
qualify him in a high degree for properly understanding
the true state of his countrymen, whilst his
Christian profession serves as a guarantee against excessive
prejudice in favour of Isl&aacute;m, has recorded his experience
of the work of Mohammadan missionaries in Liberia
and the neighbouring parts of Africa. &#8216;All careful and
candid observers,&#8217; he remarks, &#8216;agree that the influence
of Isl&aacute;m in Central and West Africa has been, upon the
whole, of a most salutary character.... As an eliminatory
and subversive agency it has displaced or unsettled
nothing as good as itself.&#8217; It has inculcated habits of
moderation and soberness over the whole of the vast region
covered by its emissaries; and so great is the influence of
its teaching, that where there are Muslim inhabitants, even
in pagan towns, it is a very rare thing to see a person
intoxicated. The Mohammadan converts drink nothing
but water. &#8216;From Senegal to Lagos, over two thousand
miles, there is scarcely an important town on the seaboard
where there is not at least one mosque and active representatives
of Isl&aacute;m, side by side with the Christian teacher.
And as soon as a pagan, however obscure or degraded,
embraces the Muslim faith, he is at once admitted as an
equal to the society.... The pagan village possessing a
Muslim teacher is always found to be in advance of its
neighbours in all the elements of civilisation.... The introduction
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcviii" id="Page_xcviii">[Pg&nbsp;xcviii]</a></span>
of Isl&aacute;m into Central and West Africa has been
the most important, if not the sole, preservative against the
desolations of the slave trade. Mohammadanism furnished
a protection to the tribes who embraced it, by effectually
binding them together in one strong religious fraternity,
and enabling them by their united efforts to baffle the
attempts of powerful slave-hunters. Enjoying this comparative
immunity from sudden hostile incursion, industry
was stimulated among them; industry diminished their
poverty; and as they increased in worldly substance, they
also increased in desire for knowledge. Receiving a desire
of letters by a study of the Arabic language, they acquired
loftier views, wider tastes, and those energetic habits which
so pleasingly distinguish them from their pagan neighbours.&#8217;
Students often travel on foot from the west coast
right across Africa to study at the great mosque of the
Azhar in Cairo. It must be remembered that these results
were observed in the very centre of African Christianity,
in Sierra Leone and other coast settlements. It is said that
in Sierra Leone three-fourths of the Muslim population
were not born Muslims, but were converted from Christianity
or paganism; and this, although &#8216;all liberated
Africans are always handed over to Christian missionaries
for instruction, and their children are baptized and brought
up at the public expense in Christian schools, and are thus,
in a sense, ready-made Christians.&#8217;</p>

<p>These facts show that, even in the present day, and with
the competition of Christian missionary societies, Isl&aacute;m
may be a power for good in poor communities&mdash;that it can
not only give them a pure instead of a degraded faith, but
can raise them socially and intellectually. The effects of
a simple form of Isl&aacute;m on these African converts may
give one some notion of its influence on its hearers in the
early days, before the theologians had corrupted it.</p>

<p>But this good influence is very partial and limited, even
among the poorer classes. In communities where all are
poor, Isl&aacute;m is an excellent agent for improvement; but in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xcix" id="Page_xcix">[Pg&nbsp;xcix]</a></span>
countries where there are many grades of wealth and rank,
the poor only ape in a humble manner the vices of those
whom they are taught to regard as their &#8216;betters.&#8217; In all
civilised and wealthy countries the social system of Isl&aacute;m
exerts a ruinous influence on all classes, and if there is to
be any great future for the Mohammadan world, that system
of society must be done away.</p>

<h3>IV.&mdash;<i>THE &#7730;UR-&Aacute;N.</i></h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Muslim who reads the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n is like the orange-fruit, whose smell and taste
are sweet; and the Muslim who reads not the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n is like the date, which hath no
smell, but its taste is sweet; and the Hypocrite who reads not the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n is like the
colocynth, without a smell, and with a bitter taste; and the Hypocrite who reads it
is like the sweet bazil, whose smell is sweet, but its taste bitter.&mdash;<i>Tradition.</i></p></div>

<p>It is an immense merit in the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n that there is no
doubt as to its genuineness. The &#8216;Word of the Lord&#8217;
came to Mo&#7717;ammad, and he uttered it, and the people
wrote it down or committed it to memory; and that very
word we can now read with full confidence that it has
remained unchanged through nearly thirteen hundred
years.</p>

<p>The revelations came to Mo&#7717;ammad in many ways and
at all times, but never &#8216;in visions bright, transcendant,
exalted. They came ghastly, weird, most horrible. After
long solitary broodings, a something used to move Mo&#7717;ammad,
all of a sudden, with frightful vehemence. He
&#8220;roared like a camel,&#8221; his eyes rolled and glowed like red
coals, and on the coldest day terrible perspirations would
break out all over his body. When the terror ceased, it
seemed to him as if he had heard bells ringing, &#8220;the sound
whereof seemed to rend him to pieces&#8221;&mdash;as if he had heard
the voice of a man&mdash;as if he had seen Gabriel&mdash;or as if
words <i>had been written in his heart</i>. Such was the agony
he endured, that some of the verses revealed to him well-nigh
made his hair turn white.&#8217;</p>

<p>No collection of these revelations was made during
Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s lifetime; at his death, the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n existed
only as scattered chaotically among the believers. But
about a year later, the death in battle of some of the men
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ci" id="Page_ci">[Pg&nbsp;ci]</a></span>
who had specially committed passages of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n to
memory, and the dread that the whole of Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s
teaching might vanish at the end of a generation or two,
induced Aboo-Bekr to make the innovation from which
every one shrank, and he gave orders to the Prophet&#8217;s
secretary, Zeyd ibn Th&aacute;bit, to collect the fragments of the
&#7730;ur-&aacute;n in one book. So Zeyd gathered the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n from
palm-leaves, skins, shoulder-blades, stones, and the hearts
of men, arranged the chapters in a certain order, and presented
Aboo-Bekr with a &#7730;ur-&aacute;n which probably differed
in no essential particular from the book we have now.
All scholars are agreed that Zeyd did his work faithfully,
and neither inserted nor omitted anything from party
motives. But he seems to have occasionally mixed up
fragments of very different date in one chapter&mdash;Mo&#7717;ammad
himself countenanced this&mdash;and may possibly have
omitted some portions that were not found till afterwards.</p>

<p>Some twenty years later a second recension was ordered
by the Khalif &acute;Othm&aacute;n. Slight varieties of reading,
mainly dialectal, had arisen; swords were near being
drawn over them; and it was evident that a serious schism
would come about if a uniform authorised text of the
&#7730;ur-&aacute;n were not provided. These slight dialectal differences
were not sufficiently settled, it would seem, in Aboo-Bekr&#8217;s
edition, so this new recension was made by Zeyd and
three men of the &#7730;ureysh, for they would best know the
original dialect of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n. The new edition followed
the first one, apparently, both in order and in matter;
definitely fixing, however, the true text in the dialect of
the &#7730;ureysh, and possibly adding any verses that might
have been discovered since Zeyd&#8217;s first edition. This
second recension was conducted with the same careful
fidelity and scrupulous impartiality as the first; and it
was accepted by all the different parties that were then
disputing the supremacy. Copies of this edition were
then distributed to the principal cities of the empire, and
the old copies and fragments were called-in and burned.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cii" id="Page_cii">[Pg&nbsp;cii]</a></span></p>

<p>This edition of &acute;Othm&aacute;n, made about <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 660, is the one
that has ever since been the authorised and only version
of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n throughout the Muslim world and in the
studies of European linguists. The only differences that
have since crept into the text are certain unimportant
varieties in vocalisation and orthography and in the division
of verses.</p>

<p>It was a singular system these early revisers went upon.
They seem, indeed, to have established the authenticity of
each saying satisfactorily; but in the arrangement of them
they showed an extraordinary dulness. The tradition
of the year when each revelation was spoken appears to
have been lost even in the short time that had elapsed
since it had been spoken. People remembered the words,
but seldom the occasion of the words. Hence the revisers
had to devise an artificial order; not according to subject,
nor after the development of the style, but simply in order
of length! They put the longest chapters first and the
shortest last; that is to say, they inverted, roughly speaking,
the true order, for the early soorahs were short and
the later ones long.</p>

<p>Read in this order, the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n is an unintelligible
jumble. Carlyle may well say that &#8216;nothing but a sense
of duty could carry any European through the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n.&#8217;
You can trace no development of mind or doctrine in the
present arrangement; it is indeed a confused mass of
&#8216;endless iterations, long-windedness, entanglement, most
crude, incondite.&#8217; But scholars have long discovered
certain signs of a true order&mdash;several kinds of evidence by
which a chronological arrangement of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n may
be attempted. These are&mdash;(1.) The <i>references to historical
events</i> in the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, as identified by tradition. These,
however, are but few, and occur chiefly in quite the latest
soorahs; and tradition is apt to identify any reference with
any event it chooses. A much more important test is (2.)
the <i>style</i>; for a distinct development can be traced in the
rime, in the length of verses, and in the words employed.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ciii" id="Page_ciii">[Pg&nbsp;ciii]</a></span>
And then there is (3.) the <i>matter</i> test, based on what we
know of Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s life, from which we can argue a certain
change in his preaching at Mekka, and still more when,
from addressing idolaters in his birthplace, he came to
preach to Jews and Christians at Medina. The danger of
this last test is that each man forms his own theory of
Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s mental and religious growth, and may arrange
the soorahs in accordance with that theory. Even
with these three tests, used by the most accomplished
critics, it is impossible to arrive at an exact order, and to
determine the precise chronological position of each soorah.
But whilst it is admitted that an exact chronological
arrangement of each individual chapter of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n is
impossible, it is yet no less certain that the soorahs may
be roughly grouped together, and that these groups can be
definitely assigned to certain periods of Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s career.</p>

<p>Professor Th. N&ouml;ldeke&#8217;s <i>Geschichte des Qor&acirc;ns</i> has established
his right to the first place in this science of &#7730;ur-&aacute;n
arrangement, and his order of soorahs may fairly be
accepted as authoritative. Of this order Mr. Rodwell&#8217;s
English version of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n is an example, except that a
few of the earliest soorahs are transposed. N&ouml;ldeke has two
great divisions of the soorahs: those revealed at Mekka,
and those revealed during the Medina period. Further,
he divides the Mekkan division into three groups.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>Read in this order the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n becomes intelligible. It
is still confused in its progression and strangely mixed in
its contents; but the development of Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s faith
can be traced in it, and we can see dimly into the workings
of his mind, as it struggles with the deep things of
God, wrestles with the doubts which echoed the cavils of
the unbelievers, soars upwards on the wings of ecstatic
faith, till at last it gains the repose of fruition. Studied
thus, the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n is no longer dull reading to one who cares
to look upon the working of a passionate troubled human
soul, and who can enter into its trials and share in the
joy of its triumphs.</p>

<p>In the soorahs revealed at Mekka, Mo&#7717;ammad has but
one theme&mdash;God; and one object&mdash;to draw his people
away from their idols and bring them to the feet of that
God. He tells them of Him in glowing language, that
comes from the heart&#8217;s white heat. He points to the
glories of nature, and tells them these are God&#8217;s works.
With all the brilliant imagery of the Arab, he tries to
show them what God is, to convince them of His power
and His wisdom and His justice. The soorahs of this
period are short, for they are pitched in too high a key
to be long sustained. The language has the ring of poetry,
though no part of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n complies with the demands of
Arab metre. The sentences are short and full of half-restrained
energy, yet with a musical cadence. The
thought is often only half expressed; one feels the speaker
has essayed a thing beyond words, and has suddenly discovered
the impotence of language, and broken off with
the sentence unfinished. There is the fascination of true
poetry about these earliest soorahs; as we read them we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cv" id="Page_cv">[Pg&nbsp;cv]</a></span>
understand the enthusiasm of the Prophet&#8217;s followers,
though we cannot fully realise the beauty and the power,
inasmuch as we cannot hear them hurled forth with
Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s fiery eloquence. From first to last the
&#7730;ur-&aacute;n is essentially a book to be heard, not read, but this
is especially the case with the earliest chapters.</p>

<p>In the soorahs of the second period of Mekka we begin
to trace the decline of the Prophet&#8217;s eloquence. There
are still the same earnest appeals to the people, the same
gorgeous pictures of the Last Day and the world to come;
but the language begins to approach the quiet of prose,
the sentences become longer, the same words and phrases
are frequently repeated, and the wearisome stories of the
Jewish prophets and patriarchs, which fill so large a place
in the later portion of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, now make their appearance.
The fierce passion of the earliest soorahs, that could
not out save in short burning verses, gives place to a calmer
more argumentative style. Mo&#7717;ammad appeals less to
the works of God as proofs of his teaching, and more to
the history of former teachers, and the punishments of
the people who would not hear them. And the characteristic
oaths of the first period, when Mo&#7717;ammad swears
by all the varied sights of nature as they mirrored themselves
in his imagination, have gone, and in their place we
find only the weaker oath &#8216;by the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n.&#8217; And this
declension is carried still further in the last group of the
soorahs revealed at Mekka. The style becomes more
involved and the sentences longer, and though the old
enthusiasm bursts forth ever and anon, it is rather an echo
of former things than a new and present intoxication
of faith. The fables and repetitions become more and
more dreary, and but for the rich eloquence of the old
Arabic tongue, which gives some charm even to inextricable
sentences and dull stories, the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n at this
period would be unreadable. As it is, we feel we have
fallen the whole depth from poetry to prose, and the
matter of the prose is not so superlative as to give us
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cvi" id="Page_cvi">[Pg&nbsp;cvi]</a></span>
amends for the loss of the poetic thought of the earlier
time and the musical fall of the sentences.</p>

<p>In the soorahs of the Medina period these faults reach
their climax. We read a singularly varied collection of
criminal laws, social regulations, orders for battle, harangues
to the Jews, first conciliatory, then denunciatory,
and exhortations to spread the faith, and such-like heterogeneous
matters. Happily the Jewish stories disappear in
the latest soorahs, but their place is filled by scarcely more
palatable materials. The chapters of this period are interesting
chiefly as containing the laws which have guided
every Muslim state, regulated every Muslim society, and
directed in their smallest acts every Mohammadan man
and woman in all parts of the world from the Prophet&#8217;s
time till now. The Medina part of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n is the most
important part for Isl&aacute;m, considered as a scheme of ritual
and a system of manners; the earliest Mekka revelations
are those which contain what is highest in a great religion
and what was purest in a great man.</p>

<p>The word <i>&#7730;ur-&aacute;n</i> means the <i>crying</i>, <i>reciting</i>, <i>reading</i>,
and is applied not only to the whole book, but to any
chapter or section of it. The &#7730;ur-&aacute;n is also called El-Fur&#7731;&aacute;n,
&#8216;the Distinguisher,&#8217; and El-Mu&#7779;&#7717;af, &#8216;the Volume,&#8217;
and El-Kit&aacute;b, &#8216;the Book,&#8217; and Edh-Dhikr, &#8216;the Admonition.&#8217;
The &#7730;ur-&aacute;n contains, in its ordinary form, 114
chapters (<i>soorahs</i>), 6616 verses (<i>&aacute;y&aacute;t</i>, literally &#8216;signs&#8217; or
&#8216;wonders&#8217;), 77,934 words, and 323,671 letters, according
to the estimates of laborious Muslim divines, which differ,
however, in a slight manner in consequence of the various
divisions of verses. After the first chapter, which is a short
prayer (the F&aacute;ti&#7717;ah), the soorahs gradually decrease in
length from 289 verses in the second to from three to six
in the ten concluding chapters. Each chapter is headed
by a title, taken from same prominent word in it (as the
&#8216;Chapter of the Striking,&#8217; &#8216;of the Cow,&#8217; &amp;c.); beneath
which is noted whether it was promulgated (according to
tradition) at Mekka or Medina, and the number of its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cvii" id="Page_cvii">[Pg&nbsp;cvii]</a></span>
verses. Then follow the words:&mdash;&#8216;In the Name of God,
the Compassionate, the Merciful;&#8217; after which the chapter
begins. To twenty-nine chapters are prefixed certain letters
(<i>e.g.</i>, ch. ii. on p. 4), or a single letter, which have never
been successfully interpreted. The Muslims believe them
to conceal profound mysteries. In Soorah 55 a refrain is
found, and traces of a like imitation in Soorahs 54 and 17.
It is probable that the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n was originally <i>chanted</i> in
somewhat the same manner as it is in the present day.</p>

<p>The &#7730;ur-&aacute;n is also divided in thirty sections, and these
are again subdivided; and from this division rather than
from chapter and verse do the Muslims generally quote.</p>

<p>&#8216;The Muslims absolutely deny that the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n was composed
by their Prophet himself, or by any other for him;
it being their general and orthodox belief that it is of divine
original; nay, that it is eternal and uncreated, remaining,
as some express it, in the very essence of God; that the
first transcript has been from everlasting by God&#8217;s throne,
written on a tablet of vast size, called the Preserved Tablet,
in which are also recorded the divine decrees, past and
future; that a copy from this tablet, in one volume on
paper, was, by the ministry of the angel Gabriel, sent
down to the lowest heaven, in the month of Rama&#7693;&aacute;n, on
the Night of Power;<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> whence Gabriel revealed it to
Mo&#7717;ammad by parcels, some at Mekka, and some at
Medina, at different times during the space of twenty-three
years, as the exigency of affairs required; giving
him, however, the consolation to show him the whole
(which they tell us was bound in silk, and adorned with
gold and precious stones of Paradise) once a year; but in
the last year of his life he had the favour to see it twice.
They say that few chapters were delivered entire, the most
part being revealed piecemeal, and written down from
time to time by the Prophet&#8217;s amanuensis, in such or such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cviii" id="Page_cviii">[Pg&nbsp;cviii]</a></span>
a part of such or such a chapter, till they were completed,
according to the directions of the angel. The first parcel
that was revealed is generally agreed to have been the first
five verses of the ninety-sixth chapter. After the new
revealed passages had been from the Prophet&#8217;s mouth taken
down in writing by his scribe, they were published to his
followers, several of whom took copies for their private
use; but the far greater number got them by heart. The
originals, when returned, were put promiscuously into a
chest, without regard to any order of time, for which reason
it is uncertain when many passages were revealed.</p>

<p>&#8216;The &#7730;ur-&aacute;n being the Muslims&#8217; rule of faith and practice,
it is no wonder its expositors and commentators are
so very numerous; and it may not be amiss to take notice
of the rules they observe in expounding it.</p>

<p>&#8216;One of the most learned commentators distinguishes
the contents of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n into allegorical and literal. The
former comprehends the more obscure, parabolical, and
enigmatical passages, and such as are repealed or abrogated;
the latter, those which are plain, perspicuous, liable
to no doubt, and in full force.</p>

<p>&#8216;To explain these severally in a right manner, it is necessary,
from tradition and study, to know the time when
each passage was revealed, its circumstances, state, and
history, and the reasons or particular emergencies for the
sake of which it was revealed. Or, more explicitly, whether
the passage was revealed at Mekka or at Medina;
whether it be abrogated, or does itself abrogate any other
passage; whether it be anticipated in order of time or
postponed; whether it be distinct from the context or
depend thereon; whether it be particular or general; and
lastly, whether it be implicit by intention, or explicit in
words.</p>

<p>&#8216;By what has been said, the reader may easily believe
that this book is held by the Muslims in the greatest
reverence and esteem. The more strict among them dare
not touch it without being first washed or legally purified;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_cix" id="Page_cix">[Pg&nbsp;cix]</a></span>
which lest they should do by inadvertence, they sometimes
write these words of the book itself on the cover or label,
&#8220;None shall touch it but they who are purified.&#8221; They
read it with great care and respect, never holding it below
their girdles. They swear by it, consult it in their weighty
occasions, carry it with them to war, inscribe sentences
from it on their banners, sometimes adorn it with gold
and precious stones, and knowingly suffer it not to be in
the possession of any person of a different persuasion. It
is the foundation of their education; and the children in
the schools are taught to chant it, and commit the whole
of it to memory.</p>

<h3>BOOKS,</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> reading a large number of works bearing upon the subjects of
this Introduction, I have remarked a curious freedom of quotation
in most of the writers. I find the same sentence, or at least the
same thought, repeated in several books without any reference to
the author who first put it forth. Each writer seems to have studied
his predecessors with such minuteness that he can quote their very
words, but he does not appear to remember whence the words
came. When a thought has once been perfectly expressed, it were
a ridiculous vanity to seek to frame it in different words, and so far
it is undoubtedly wise to make use of the best of what has preceded
us; nevertheless, it is well to acknowledge our debt. Yet thoughts,
and even phrases, impress themselves on the memory till one unconsciously
comes to appropriate them as his own; and this, I
doubt not, is the cause of much of the plagiarism I have noticed.
It is extremely probable that I have been guilty of the same sin. I
have crowded my pages with marks of quotation, sometimes with
foot references, sometimes without (for the student of the subject
will know where to look for them), but it is quite likely that I have
often unconsciously used another&#8217;s phrase or metaphor without
rendering thanks. So I now append a list of the principal European
books I have used, and beg once and for all to record my indebtedness
to their writers. The original Arabic authorities will dispense
with my acknowledgments, and the catalogue of them would not
assist the English reader who wishes to proceed further in the study
of the subject, for whom this list may prove useful.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The following extracts were all translated by Mr. Lane, with the exception
of those to which an obelus (&#8224;) is prefixed, for which I alone am responsible.
In the text, the words in italics are inserted from the commentary of the
Jel&aacute;leyn; words in square brackets [] are Mr. Lane&#8217;s additions, inserted
where the difference between the Arabic and English idioms required them.</p>

<p>In the foot-notes, words in italics are from the commentary of the Jel&aacute;leyn;
notes followed by the initial S., from Sale&#8217;s <i>Koran</i>; the letters B., Z.,
and A. F., following S. in parenthesis, point to the authorities from which
Sale&#8217;s note was derived, the great commentaries of El-Beyd&aacute;wee and Ez-Zamakhsharee,
and Abu-l-Fid&aacute;&#8217;s Life of Mo&#7717;ammad, respectively. The other
notes are Mr. Lane&#8217;s, either from the original edition or extracted from his
<i>Modern Egyptians</i> (5th 1 vol. ed. 1860), or his notes to the <i>Thousand and
One Nights</i> (2d ed. 1859); except those enclosed in square brackets, which
are due to myself.</p>

unbelievers: (But fear God if ye be believers:)</p>

<p>And <i>those who</i> when ye call to prayer make it a laughing-stock

<h3><i>ADAM AND EVE.</i></h3>

<p><i>Remember, O Mo&#7717;ammad</i>, when thy Lord said unto the
angels, I am about to place in the earth a vicegerent <i>to act
for me in the execution of my ordinances therein, namely,
Adam</i>,&mdash;they said, Wilt Thou place in it one who will
corrupt in it <i>by disobediences</i>, and will shed blood (<i>as did
the sons of El-J&aacute;nn,<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> who were in it; wherefore, when they
acted corruptly, God sent to them the angels, who drove them
away to the islands and the mountains</i>), when we [on the
contrary] celebrate the divine perfection, <i>occupying ourselves</i>
with Thy praise, and extol Thy holiness? <i>Therefore we
are more worthy of the vicegerency.</i>&mdash;<i>God</i> replied, Verily, I
know that which ye know not, <i>as to the affair of appointing
Adam vicegerent, and that among his posterity will be
the obedient and the rebellious, and the just will be manifest
among them. And He created Adam from the surface of
the earth, taking a handful of every colour that it comprised,
which was kneaded with various waters; and He completely
formed it, and breathed into it the soul: so it became an animated
sentient being.</i><a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> And He taught Adam the names of
all things, <i>infusing the knowledge of them into his heart</i>.
Then He showed them (<i>namely, the things</i>) to the angels,
and said, Declare unto me the names of these <i>things</i>, if ye
say truth <i>in your assertion that I will not create any more
knowing than ye, and that ye are more worthy of the vicegerency</i>.
They replied, [<i>We extol</i>] Thy perfection! We have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
no knowledge excepting what Thou hast taught us; for
Thou art the Knowing, the Wise.&mdash;<i>God</i> said, O Adam, tell
them their names. And when he had told them their
names, <i>God</i> said, Did I not say unto you that I know the
secrets of the heavens and the earth, and know what ye
reveal <i>of your words, saying, Wilt thou place in it</i>, etc., and
what ye did conceal <i>of your words, saying, He will not
create any more generous towards Him than we, nor any
more knowing</i>?</p>

<p class="name">(ii. 28-31.)</p>

<p>We created you; <i>that is, your father Adam</i>: then we
formed you; <i>we formed him, and you in him</i>: then We said
unto the angels, Prostrate yourselves unto Adam, <i>by way
of salutation</i>; whereupon they prostrated themselves, except
Iblees, <i>the father of the jinn, who was amid the angels</i>:
he was not of those who prostrated themselves. <i>God</i> said,
What hath hindered thee from prostrating thyself, when
I commanded thee? He answered, I am better than he:
Thou hast created me of fire, and Thou hast created him
of earth. [God] said, Then descend thou from it; <i>that is,
from Paradise; or, as some say, from the heavens</i>; for it is
not fit for thee that thou behave thyself proudly therein:
so go thou forth: verily thou [shalt be] of the contemptible.
He replied, Grant me respite until the day
when they (<i>that is, mankind</i>) shall be raised from the dead.
He said, Thou shalt be of those [who are] respited: <i>and,
in another verse</i> [in xv. 38, it is said], <i>until the day of the
known period; that is, until the period of the first blast</i> [of
the trumpet]. [And the devil] said, Now, as Thou hast
led me into error, I will surely lay wait for them (<i>that is,
for the sons of Adam</i>) in Thy right way, <i>the way that
leadeth to Thee</i>: then I will surely come upon them, from
before them, and from behind them, and from their right
hands, and from their left, <i>and hinder them from pursuing
the way</i> (<i>but, saith Ibn-&acute;Abb&aacute;s, he cannot come upon them
above, lest he should intervene between the servant and God&#8217;s
mercy</i>), and Thou shalt not find the greater number of them
grateful, <i>or believing</i>. [God] said, Go forth from it, despised
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
and driven away <i>from mercy</i>. Whosoever of them
(<i>that is, of mankind</i>) shall follow thee, I will surely fill
hell with you all; <i>with thee, and thy offspring, and with
men</i>.</p>

<p class="name">(vii. 10-17.)</p>

<p>And we said, O Adam, dwell thou and thy wife (<i>Howw&aacute;</i>
[or Eve], <i>whom God created from a rib of his left side</i>) in
the garden, and eat ye therefrom plentifully, wherever ye
will; but approach ye not this tree, <i>to eat thereof</i>; (<i>and it
was wheat, or the grape-vine, or some other tree</i>;) for <i>if ye
do so</i>, ye will be of <i>the number of</i> the offenders. But the
devil, <i>Iblees</i>, caused them to slip from it, <i>that is, from the
garden, by his saying unto them, Shall I show you the way to
the tree of eternity? And he swore to them by God that he
was one of the faithful advisers to them: so they ate of it</i>,
and He ejected them from that <i>state of delight</i> in which
they were. And We said, Descend ye<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> <i>to the earth, ye two
with the offspring that ye comprise</i> [yet unborn], one of you
(<i>that is, of your offspring</i>) an enemy to another; and there
shall be for you, in the earth, a place of abode, and a provision,
<i>of its vegetable produce</i>, for a time, <i>until the period
of the expiration of your terms of life</i>. And Adam learned,
from his Lord, words, <i>which were these</i>:&mdash;<i>O Lord, we have
acted unjustly to our own souls, and if Thou do not forgive
us, and be merciful unto us, we shall surely be of those who
suffer loss</i>.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> <i>And he prayed in these words</i>; and He became
propitious towards him, <i>accepting his repentance</i>; for He is
the Very Propitious, the Merciful. We said, Descend ye
from it (<i>from the garden</i>) altogether; and if there come
unto you from Me a direction (<i>a book and an apostle</i>), those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
who follow my direction, <i>there shall come</i> no fear on them,
nor shall they grieve <i>in the world to come; for they shall
enter paradise</i>: but they who disbelieve and accuse our
signs<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> of falsehood, these shall be the companions of the
fire: they shall remain therein for ever.</p>

<h3><i>ABEL AND CAIN.</i></h3>

<p>Recite, <i>O Mo&#7717;ammad</i>, unto them (<i>that is, to thy people</i>) the
history of the two sons of Adam, <i>namely, Abel and Cain</i>,<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a>
with truth. When they offered [their] offering <i>to God</i><a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a>
(<i>Abel&#8217;s being a ram, and Cain&#8217;s being produce of the earth</i>),
and it was accepted from one of them (<i>that is, from Abel;
for fire descended from heaven, and devoured his offering</i>),
and it was not accepted from the other, <i>Cain was enraged;
but he concealed his envy until Adam performed a pilgrimage,
when</i> he said <i>unto his brother</i>, I will assuredly slay
thee. <i>Abel said, Wherefore? Cain answered, Because of
the acceptance of thine offering to the exclusion of mine.</i>
<i>Abel</i> replied, God only accepteth from the pious. If thou
stretch forth to me thy hand to slay me, I will not stretch
forth to thee my hand to slay thee; for I fear God, the
Lord of the worlds. I desire that thou shouldst bear the
sin [which thou intendest to commit] against me, <i>by slaying
me</i>, and thy sin <i>which thou hast committed before</i>, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
thou wilt be of the companions of the fire.&mdash;And that
is the recompense of the offenders.&mdash;But his soul suffered
him to slay his brother: so he slew him; and he became
of [the number of] those who suffer loss. <i>And he knew not
what to do with him; for he was the first dead person upon
the face of the earth of the sons of Adam. So he carried
him upon his back.</i> And God sent a raven, which scratched
up the earth <i>with its bill and its talons and raised it over a
dead raven that was with it until it hid it</i>, to show him
how he should hide the corpse of his brother. He said,
O my disgrace! Am I unable to be like this raven,
and to hide the corpse of my brother?&mdash;And he became of
[the number of] the repentant. <i>And he digged</i> [a grave]
<i>for him, and hid him</i>.&mdash;On account of this <i>which Cain did</i>
We commanded the children of Israel that he who should
slay a soul (not for <i>the latter&#8217;s having slain</i> a soul or
<i>committed</i> wickedness in the earth, <i>such as infidelity, or
adultery, or intercepting the way, and the like</i>) [should be
regarded] as though he had slain all mankind; and he
who saveth it alive, <i>by abstaining from slaying it</i>, as though
he had saved alive all mankind.</p>

<h3><i>NOAH AND THE FLOOD.</i></h3>

<p>We formerly sent Noah [Noo&#7717;] unto his people, <i>saying</i>,
Verily I am unto you a plain admonisher that ye worship
not [any] but God. Verily I fear for you, <i>if ye worship
any other</i>, the punishment of an afflictive day <i>in this world
and in the world to come</i>.&mdash;But the chiefs who disbelieved
among his people replied, We see thee not to be other than
a man, like unto us; and we see not any to have followed
thee except the meanest of us, <i>as the weavers and the
cobblers</i>, at first thought (<i>or rashly</i>), nor do we see you to
have any excellence above us: nay, we imagine you to be
liars <i>in your claim to the apostolic commission</i>. He said,
O my people, tell me, if I have an evident proof from my
Lord and He hath bestowed on me mercy (<i>the gift of
prophecy</i>) from Himself which is hidden from you, shall
we compel you to <i>receive</i> it when ye are averse thereto?
<i>We cannot do so.</i> And, O my people, I ask not of you
any riches for it; <i>namely, for delivering my message</i>. My
reward is not due from any but God; and I will not drive
away those who have believed <i>as ye have commanded me</i>
[because they are poor people]. Verily they shall meet
their Lord <i>at the resurrection, and He will recompense them,
and will exact for them</i> [reparation] <i>from those who have
treated them with injustice, and driven them away</i>. But I
see you [to be] a people who are ignorant <i>of the end of your
case</i>. And, O my people, who will defend me against God
if I drive them away? Will ye not then consider? And
I do not say unto you, I have the treasures of God; nor
[do I say], I know the things unseen; nor do I say, Verily
I am an angel; nor do I say, of those whom your eyes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
contemn, God will by no means bestow on them good:
(God best knoweth what is in their minds:) verily I
should in that case be [one] of the offenders.&mdash;They replied,
O Noah, thou hast disputed with us and multiplied
disputes with us: now bring upon us that <i>punishment</i>
wherewith thou threatenest us, if thou be of those
that speak truth. He said, Only God will bring it upon
you, if He please <i>to hasten it unto you; for it is His affair,
not mine</i>; and ye shall not escape <i>God</i>: nor will my counsel
profit you, if I desire to counsel you, if God desire to
lead you into error. He is your Lord; and unto Him shall
ye be brought back.</p>

<p class="name">(xi. 27-36.)</p>

<p>And it was said by revelation unto Noah, Verily there
shalt not believe of thy people [any] but they who have
already believed; therefore be not grieved for that which
they have done.</p>

<p class="name">(xi. 38.)</p>

<p><i>And he uttered an imprecation upon them, saying</i>, O my
Lord, leave not upon the earth any one of the unbelievers;
for if Thou leave them, they will lead Thy servants into
error, and will not beget [any] but a wicked, ungrateful
[offspring]. O my Lord, forgive me and my parents (<i>for
they were believers</i>), and whomsoever entereth my house
(<i>my abode, or my place of worship</i>), being a believer, and
the believing men, and the believing women, (<i>to the day of
resurrection</i>), and add not to the offenders [aught] save
destruction.</p>

<p class="name">(lxxi. 27-29.)</p>

<p><i>And God answered his prayer, and said</i>, Construct the
ark in our sight and according to our revelation, and speak
not unto Me concerning those who have offended, <i>to beg Me
not to destroy them</i>; for they [shall be] drowned. And he
constructed the ark; and whenever a company of his
people passed by him, they derided him. He said, If ye
deride us, we will deride you, like as ye deride, <i>when we
are saved and ye are drowned</i>, and ye shall know on whom
shall come a punishment which shall render him vile, and
whom shall befall a lasting punishment. [Thus he was
employed] until when Our decree <i>for their destruction</i> came
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>
to pass, and the <i>baker&#8217;s</i> oven overflowed <i>with water</i><a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> (<i>for
this was a signal unto Noah</i>), We said, Carry into it (<i>that
is, into the ark</i>) of every pair, <i>male and female, of each of
these descriptions</i>, two (<i>and it is related that God assembled
for Noah the wild beasts and the birds and other creatures,
and he proceeded to put his hands upon each kind, and his
right hand fell always upon the male, and his left upon the
female, and he carried them into the ark</i>), and thy family
(excepting him upon whom the sentence <i>of destruction</i> hath
already been pronounced, <i>namely, Noah&#8217;s wife, and his son
Canaan: but Shem and Ham and Japheth and their three
wives he took</i>), and those who have believed; but there
believed not with him save a few: <i>they were six men and
their wives: and it is said that all who were in the ark were
eighty, half of whom were men and half women</i>. And <i>Noah</i>
said, Embark ye therein. In the name of God [be] its
course and its mooring.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> Verily my Lord is very forgiving
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
[and] merciful.&mdash;And it moved along with them amid
waves like mountains; and Noah called unto his son,
<i>Canaan</i>, who was apart <i>from the ark</i>, O my child, embark
with us, and be not with the unbelievers! He replied, I
will betake me to a mountain which will secure me from
the water. [Noah] said, There is nought that will secure
to-day from the decree of God [any] but him on whom
He hath mercy. And the waves intervened between them;
so he became [one] of the drowned. And it was said, O
earth, swallow up thy water (<i>whereupon it drank it up,
except what had descended from heaven, which became rivers
and seas</i>), and, O heaven, cease <i>from raining</i>;&mdash;and the
water abated, and the decree was fulfilled, and it (<i>namely,
the ark</i>) rested on El-Joodee (<i>a mountain of El-Jezeereh,
near El-M&oacute;sil</i>); and it was said, Perdition to the offending
people!<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a></p>

<p class="name">(xi. 38-46.)</p>

<p>And Noah called upon his Lord, and said, O my Lord,
verily my son is of my family, <i>and Thou hast promised me
to save them</i>, and verily Thy promise is true, and Thou art
the most just of those who exercise judgment. <i>God</i> replied,
O Noah, verily he is not of thy family <i>who should
be saved, or of the people of thy religion</i>. Verily it (<i>namely,
thine asking me to save him</i>) is not a righteous act; <i>for he
was an unbeliever, and there is no safety for the unbelievers</i>;
therefore ask not of me that wherein thou hast no knowledge.
I admonish thee, lest thou become [one] of the
ignorant.&mdash;<i>Noah</i> said, O my Lord, I beg Thee to preserve
me from asking Thee that wherein I have no knowledge;
and if Thou do not forgive me and have mercy upon me, I
shall be of those who suffer loss.&mdash;It was said, O Noah,
descend <i>from the ark</i>,<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> with peace from Us, and blessings,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
upon thee and upon peoples [that shall proceed] from
those who are with thee <i>in the ark</i> (<i>that is, their believing
posterity</i>); but peoples [that shall proceed] <i>from those who
are with thee</i> We will permit to enjoy <i>the provisions of this
world</i>; then a painful punishment shall befall them from
Us, <i>in the world to come; they being unbelievers</i>.</p>

<h3><i>&acute;AD AND THAMOOD.</i></h3>

<p>And <i>we sent</i> unto <i>the former</i> [tribe of] &acute;&Aacute;d<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> their brother
Hood.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> He said, O my people, worship God: <i>assert His
unity</i>. Ye have no other deity than Him. Will ye not
then fear <i>Him, and believe</i>?&mdash;The chiefs who disbelieved
among his people answered, Verily we see thee to be in a
foolish way, and verily we esteem thee one of the liars
<i>with respect to the apostolic commission</i>. He replied, O my
people, there is no folly in me; but I am an apostle from
the Lord of the worlds. I bring unto you the messages of
my Lord, and I am unto you a counsellor, intrusted <i>with
the apostolic office</i>. Do ye wonder that an admonition hath
come unto you from your Lord by <i>the tongue of</i> a man from
among you, that he may warn you? And remember how
He hath appointed you vicegerents <i>in the earth</i> after the
people of Noah, and increased you in tallness of stature.
(<i>For the tall among them was a hundred cubits, and the short
among them sixty.</i>) Remember, then, the benefits of God,
that ye may prosper. They said, Art thou come unto
us that we may worship God alone, and relinquish what
our fathers worshipped? Then bring upon us that <i>punishment</i>
with which thou threatenest us, if thou be of those
who speak truth.&mdash;He replied, Punishment and indignation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
from your Lord have become necessary for you. Do
ye dispute with me concerning names which ye and your
fathers have given <i>to idols which ye worship</i>, concerning
which (<i>that is, the worship of which</i>) God hath not set down
any convincing proof? Then await ye <i>the punishment</i>. I
am with you, of those who await <i>that, for your accusing me
of falsehood. And the unprofitable wind was sent upon them.</i>
But We delivered him (<i>namely, Hood</i>) and them who were
with him (<i>of the believers</i>) by Our mercy; and We cut off
the uppermost part of those who charged Our signs with
falsehood and who were not believers.</p>

<p>And <i>We sent</i> unto <i>the tribe of</i> Thamood<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> their brother
&#7778;&aacute;li&#7717;. He said, O my people, worship God. Ye have no
other deity than Him. A <i>miraculous</i> proof <i>of my veracity</i>
hath come unto you from your Lord, this she-camel of God
being a sign unto you. [He had caused her, at their demand,
to come forth from the heart of a rock.] Therefore
let her feed in God&#8217;s earth, and do her no harm, lest a
painful punishment seize you. And remember how He
hath appointed you vicegerents <i>in the earth</i> after [the tribe
of] &acute;&Aacute;d, and given you a habitation in the earth: ye make
yourselves, on its plains, pavilions <i>wherein ye dwell in summer</i>,
and cut the mountains into houses <i>wherein ye dwell in
winter</i>. Remember then the benefits of God, and do not
evil in the earth, acting corruptly.&mdash;The chiefs who were
elated with pride, among his people, said unto those who
were esteemed weak, <i>namely</i>, to those who had believed
among them, Do ye know that &#7778;&aacute;li&#7717; hath been sent <i>unto
you</i> from his Lord? They answered, <i>Yea</i>: verily we believe
in that wherewith he hath been sent. Those who
were elated with pride replied, Verily we disbelieve in that
wherein ye have believed.&mdash;<i>And the she-camel had a day
to water; and they had a day; and they became weary of</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>

great earthquake, and a cry from heaven</i><a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a>) assailed them,
and in the morning they were in their dwellings prostrate

<i>that he required</i>. And he followed a way <i>towards a
place where the sun setteth</i>, until, when he came to the place
where the sun setteth, he found that it set in a spring of
black mud, <i>as it appeared to the eye; but really that spring was
greater than the world</i>; and he found near it a people <i>who
were unbelievers</i>.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> We said, <i>by inspiration</i>, O Dhu-l-&#7730;arneyn,
either punish <i>the people by slaughter</i>, or proceed against
them gently, <i>taking them captive</i>. He said, As to him
who offendeth <i>by polytheism</i>, we will punish him <i>by
slaughter</i>: then he shall be taken back to his Lord, and He
will punish him with a severe punishment, <i>in the fire of</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
<i>hell</i>. But as to him who believeth, and doeth that which
is right, he shall have as a reward paradise, and We will
say unto him, in Our command, <i>that which will be</i> easy <i>unto
him</i>.&mdash;Then he followed a way <i>towards the place where the
sun riseth</i>, until, when he came to the place where the sun
riseth, he found that it rose upon a people (<i>namely, the Zenj</i>)
unto whom We had not given anything wherewith to
shelter themselves therefrom, <i>neither clothing nor roof; for
their land bore no building; but they had subterranean
dwellings, into which they retired at sunrise, and they came
forth when the sun was high</i>. Thus <i>was the case</i>; and We
comprehended with Our knowledge what were with him
(<i>namely, Dhu-l-&#7730;arneyn</i>), <i>of weapons and forces and other
things</i>.&mdash;Then he followed a way until, when he came
between the two barriers (<i>or mountains, at the confines of
the country of the Turks, between which is the barrier of El-Iskender,
as will be related presently</i>), he found before them
a people who could scarce understand speech. They said,
O Dhu-l-&#7730;arneyn, verily Y&aacute;jooj and M&aacute;jooj [Gog and Magog<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a>]
are corrupting in the earth, <i>by plunder and tyranny,
when they came forth unto us</i>. Shall we therefore pay thee
tribute, on the condition that thou make a barrier between
us and them?&mdash;He answered, The ability which my Lord
hath given me, <i>by wealth and other things</i>, is better <i>than
your tribute, which I need not. I will make the barrier for
you gratuitously</i>: but assist me strenuously <i>by doing that
which I desire</i>: I will make between you and them a strong
barrier. Bring me pieces of iron <i>of the size of the blocks of
stone used in building.&mdash;And he built with them, and placed
amid them firewood and charcoal</i>, until, when it [the mass]
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
filled up the space between the upper parts of the two
mountains, <i>and he had put the bellows and fire around that
mass</i>, he said, Blow ye [with the bellows]. <i>So they blew</i>
until, when he had made it (<i>that is, the iron</i>) <i>like</i> fire, he
said, Bring me molten brass, that I may pour upon it.
<i>And he poured the molten brass upon the heated iron, so that
it entered between its pieces and the whole became one mass.</i>
And they (<i>namely, Y&aacute;jooj and M&aacute;jooj</i>) were not able to
ascend to its top <i>by reason of its height and smoothness</i>;
nor were they able to perforate it <i>by reason of its hardness
and thickness</i>. <i>Dhu-l-&#7730;arneyn</i> said, This (<i>namely, the
barrier, or the gift of the ability to construct it</i>) is a mercy
from my Lord: but when the promise of my Lord, <i>as to the
eruption of Y&aacute;jooj and M&aacute;jooj shortly before the resurrection</i>,
shall come <i>to be fulfilled</i>, He will reduce it (<i>namely, the
barrier</i>) to dust; and the promise of my Lord concerning
<i>their eruption and other events</i> is true. And We will suffer
some of them, on that day (<i>the day of their eruption</i>), to
pour tumultuously among others: and the trumpet shall be
blown <i>for the resurrection</i>, and We will gather them (<i>namely,
all creatures</i>) together in a body, <i>in one place</i>. And We
will set hell, on that day, <i>near</i> before the unbelievers,
whose eyes have been veiled from my admonition (<i>the
&#7730;ur-&aacute;n</i>), <i>and who, being blind, have not been directed by it</i>,
and who could not hear <i>what the prophet recited unto them,
by reason of their hatred of him; wherefore they believed not
in him</i>.</p>

<h3><i>ABRAHAM, ISHMAEL, ISAAC.</i></h3>

<p><i>Remember</i> when Abraham [Ibr&aacute;heem] said to his father
A&acute;zar (<i>this was the surname of Terah</i>), Dost thou take
images as deities?<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> Verily I see thee and thy people to
be in a manifest error.&mdash;(And thus, <i>as We showed him the
error of his father and his people</i>, did We show Abraham
the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and [We did so]
that he might be of [the number of] those who firmly
believe.) And when the night overshadowed him, he saw
a star (<i>it is said that it was Venus</i>), [and] he said <i>unto his
people, who were astrologers</i>, This is my Lord, <i>according to
your assertion</i>.&mdash;But when it set, he said, I like not those
that set, <i>to take them as Lords, since it is not meet for a Lord
to experience alteration and change of place, as they are of
the nature of accidents</i>. <i>Yet this had no effect upon them.</i>
And when he saw the moon rising, he said <i>unto them</i>, This
is my Lord.&mdash;But when it set, he said, Verily if my Lord
direct me not (<i>if He confirm me not in the right way</i>), I
shall assuredly be of the erring people.&mdash;<i>This was a
hint to his people that they were in error; but it had no
effect upon them.</i> And when he saw the sun rising, he said,
This is my Lord. This is greater <i>than the star and the
moon</i>.&mdash;But when it set, <i>and the proof had been rendered
more strong to them, yet they desisted not</i>, he said, O my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>
people, verily I am clear of the [things] which ye associate
<i>with God; namely, the images and the heavenly bodies</i>. <i>So
they said unto him, What dost thou worship?</i> <i>He answered</i>,
Verily I direct my face unto Him who hath created the
heavens and the earth, following the right religion, and I
am not of the polytheists.&mdash;And his people argued with
him; [but] he said, Do ye argue with me respecting God,
when He hath directed me, and I fear not what ye
associate with Him, unless my Lord will <i>that</i> aught <i>displeasing
should befall me</i>? My Lord comprehendeth everything
by <i>His</i> knowledge. Will ye not therefore consider?
And wherefore should I fear what ye have associated <i>with
God</i>, when ye fear not for your having associated with God
that of which He hath not sent down unto you a proof?
Then which of the two parties is the more worthy of
safety? <i>Are we, or you?</i> If ye know <i>who is the more
worthy of it, follow him</i>.&mdash;<i>God saith</i>, They who have
believed, and not mixed their belief with injustice (<i>that is,
polytheism</i>), for these shall be safety <i>from punishment</i>, and
they are rightly directed.</p>

<p class="name">(vi. 74-82.)</p>

<p>Relate <i>unto them</i>, in the book (<i>that is, the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n</i>), <i>the
history of</i> Abraham. Verily he was a person of great
veracity, a prophet. When he said unto his father <i>A&acute;zar,
who worshipped idols</i>, O my father, wherefore dost thou
worship that which heareth not, nor seeth, nor averteth
from thee aught, <i>whether of advantage or of injury</i>? O
my father, verily [a degree] of knowledge hath come unto
me, that hath not come unto thee: therefore follow me:
I will direct thee into a right way. O my father, serve not
the devil, <i>by obeying him in serving idols</i>; for the devil is
very rebellious unto the Compassionate. O my father,
verily I fear that a punishment will betide thee from the
Compassionate, <i>if thou repent not</i>, and that thou wilt be
unto the devil an aider, <i>and a companion in hell-fire</i>.&mdash;He
replied, Art thou a rejector of my Gods, O Abraham, <i>and
dost thou revile them</i>? If thou abstain not, I will assuredly
assail thee <i>with stones or with ill words; therefore beware of</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span>
<i>me</i>, and leave me for a long time.&mdash;<i>Abraham</i> said, Peace
<i>from me</i> be on thee! I will ask pardon for thee of my
Lord; for He is gracious unto me: and I will separate
myself from you and from what ye invoke instead of God;
and I will call upon my Lord: perhaps I shall not be unsuccessful
in calling upon my Lord, <i>as ye are in calling
upon idols</i>.&mdash;And when he had separated himself from
them, and from what they worshipped instead of God, <i>by
going to the Holy Land</i>, We gave him <i>two sons, that he might
cheer himself thereby, namely</i>, Isaac and Jacob; and each [of
them] We made a prophet; and We bestowed upon them
(<i>namely, the three</i>), of our mercy, <i>wealth and children</i>; and
We caused them to receive high commendation.</p>

<p class="name">(xix. 42-51.)</p>

<p>We gave unto Abraham his direction formerly, <i>before he
had attained to manhood</i>; and We knew him <i>to be worthy
of it</i>. When he said unto his father and his people, What
are these images, to <i>the worship of</i> which ye are devoted?&mdash;they
answered, We found our fathers worshipping them,
<i>and we have followed their example</i>. He said <i>unto them</i>,
Verily ye and your fathers have been in a manifest error.
They said, Hast thou come unto us with truth <i>in saying
this</i>, or art thou of those who jest? He answered,
Nay, your Lord (<i>the being who deserveth to be worshipped</i>)
is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, who created
them, <i>not after the similitude of anything pre-existing</i>; and
I am of those who bear witness thereof. And, by God,
I will assuredly devise a plot against your idols after
ye shall have retired, turning your backs.&mdash;So, <i>after they
had gone to their place of assembly, on a day when they held
a festival</i>, he brake them in pieces <i>with an axe</i>, except the
chief of them, <i>upon whose neck he hung the axe</i>; that they
might return unto it (<i>namely, the chief</i>) <i>and see what he
had done with the others</i>. They said, <i>after they had
returned and seen what he had done</i>, Who hath done this
unto our gods? Verily he is of the unjust.&mdash;<i>And
some of them</i> said, We heard a young man mention them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>
<i>reproachfully</i>: he is called Abraham. They said, Then
bring him before the eyes of the people, that they may
bear witness <i>against him of his having done it</i>. They said
<i>unto him, when he had been brought</i>, Hast thou done this
unto our gods, O Abraham? He answered, Nay, this
their chief did it: and ask ye them, if they [can] speak.
And they returned unto themselves, <i>upon reflection</i>, and
said <i>unto themselves</i>, Verily ye are the unjust, <i>in worshipping
that which speaketh not</i>. Then they reverted to their
obstinacy, <i>and said</i>, Verily thou knowest that these speak
not: <i>then wherefore dost thou order us to ask them?</i> He
said, Do ye then worship, instead of God, that which doth
not profit you at all, nor injure you <i>if ye worship it not</i>?
Fy on you, and on that which ye worship instead of God!
Do ye not then understand?&mdash;They said, Burn ye him,
and avenge your gods, if ye will do <i>so</i>. <i>So they collected
abundance of firewood for him, and set fire to it; and they
bound Abraham, and put him into an engine, and cast him
into the fire.</i> <i>But, saith God</i>, We said, O fire, be thou cold,
and a security unto Abraham! <i>So nought of him was
burned save his bonds: the heat of the fire ceased, but its
light remained; and by God&#8217;s saying, Security,&mdash;Abraham
was saved from dying, by reason of its cold.</i> And they
intended against him a plot; but he caused them to be
the sufferers.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> And We delivered him and Lot, <i>the son of</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>
<i>his brother Haran, from El-&acute;Er&aacute;&#7731;</i>, [bringing them] unto
the land which we blessed for the peoples, <i>by the abundance
of its rivers and trees, namely, Syria. Abraham took
up his abode in Palestine, and Lot in El-Mu-tekifeh, between
which is a day&#8217;s journey.</i> And <i>when Abraham had asked a
son</i>, We gave unto him Isaac, and Jacob as an additional
gift, <i>beyond what he had asked, being a son&#8217;s son</i>; and all of
them We made righteous persons <i>and prophets</i>. And We
made them models of religion who directed <i>men</i> by Our
command <i>unto Our religion</i>; and We commanded them
by inspiration to do good works and to perform prayer
and to give the appointed alms; and they served Us. And
unto Lot We gave judgment and knowledge; and We delivered
him from the city which committed filthy actions;
for they were a people of evil, shameful doers; and We
admitted him into our mercy; for he was [one] of the
righteous.</p>

<p class="name">(xxi. 52-75.)</p>

<p>Hast thou not considered him who disputed with Abraham
concerning his Lord, because God had given him the
kingdom? <i>And he was Nimrod.</i> When Abraham said,
(<i>upon his saying unto him, Who is thy Lord, unto whom
thou invitest us?</i>), My Lord is He who giveth life and
causeth to die,&mdash;he replied, I give life and cause to die.&mdash;<i>And
he summoned two men, and slew one of them, and
left the other. So when he saw that he understood not</i>,
Abraham said, And verily God bringeth the sun from the
east: now do thou bring it from the west.&mdash;And he who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>
disbelieved was confounded; and God directeth not the
offending people.</p>

<p class="name">(ii. 260.)</p>

<p>And Our messengers came formerly unto Abraham with
good tidings <i>of Isaac and Jacob, who should be after him</i>.
They said, Peace. He replied, <i>Peace be on you</i>. And he
tarried not, but brought a roasted calf. And when he saw
that their hands touched it not, he disliked them and
conceived a fear of them. They said, Fear not: for we
are sent unto the people of Lot, <i>that we may destroy them</i>.
And his wife <i>Sarah</i> was standing <i>serving them</i>, and she
laughed, <i>rejoicing at the tidings of their destruction</i>. And
we gave her good tidings of Isaac [Is&#7717;&aacute;&#7731;]; and after
Isaac, Jacob [Ya&#7841;&#7731;oob]. She said, Alas! shall I bear a
child when I am an old woman, <i>of nine and ninety years</i>,
and when this my husband is an old man, <i>of a hundred
or a hundred and twenty years</i>? Verily this [would be]
a wonderful thing.&mdash;They said, Dost thou wonder at the
command of God? The mercy of God and His blessings
be on you, O people of the house (<i>of Abraham</i>)!
for He is praiseworthy, glorious.&mdash;And when the terror
had departed from Abraham, and the good tidings had
come unto him, he disputed with Us (<i>that is, with Our
messengers</i>) respecting the people of Lot; for Abraham
was gentle, compassionate, repentant. <i>And he said unto
them, Will ye destroy a city wherein are three hundred
believers? They answered, No. He said, And will ye destroy
a city wherein are two hundred believers? They
answered, No. He said, And will ye destroy a city wherein
are forty believers? They answered, No. He said, And
will ye destroy a city wherein are fourteen believers? They
answered, No. He said, And tell me, if there be in it one
believer? They answered, No. He said, Verily in it is Lot.
They replied, We know best who is in it. And when their
dispute had become tedious, they said</i>, O Abraham, abstain
from this <i>disputation</i>; for the command of thy Lord hath
come <i>for their destruction</i>, and a punishment not [to be]
averted is coming upon them.</p>

<p class="name">xi. 72-78.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span></p>

<p>And when Our decree for <i>the destruction of the people of
Lot</i> came [to be executed], We turned them (<i>that is, their
cities</i>) upside-down; <i>for Gabriel raised them to heaven, and
let them fall upside-down to the earth</i>;<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> and We rained
upon them stones of baked clay, sent one after another,
marked with thy Lord, <i>each with the name of him upon
whom it should be cast</i>: and they [are] not far distant from
the offenders; <i>that is, the stones are not, or the cities of the
people of Lot were not, far distant from the people of
Mekkeh</i>.</p>

<p class="name">(xi. 84.)</p>

<p>And [Abraham] said [after his escape from Nimrod],
Verily I am going unto my Lord, who will direct me <i>unto
the place whither He hath commanded me to go, namely, Syria.
And when he had arrived at the Holy Land, he said</i>, O my
Lord, give me <i>a son</i> [who shall be one] of the righteous.
Whereupon We gave him the glad tidings of a mild youth.
And when he had attained to the age when he could work
with him (<i>as some say, seven years; and some, thirteen</i>), he
said, O my child, verily I have seen in a dream that I should
sacrifice thee (<i>and the dreams of prophets are true; and
their actions, by the command of God</i>); therefore consider
what thou seest advisable <i>for me to do</i>. He replied, O my
father, do what thou art commanded: thou shalt find me, if
God please, [of the number] of the patient. And when
they had resigned themselves, and he had laid him down
on his temple, <i>in</i> [the valley of] <i>Mind, and had drawn the
knife across his throat</i> (<i>but it produced no effect, by reason of
an obstacle interposed by the divine power</i>), We called unto
him, O Abraham, thou hast verified the vision. Verily
thus do We reward the well-doers. Verily this was the
manifest trial. And We ransomed him <i>whom he had been
commanded to sacrifice</i> (<i>and he was Ishm&#551;el</i> [Ism&aacute;&acute;eel] <i>or
Isaac; for there are two opinions</i>)<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> with an excellent victim,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
<i>a ram from Paradise, the same that Abel had offered:
Gabriel</i> (<i>on whom be peace!</i>) <i>brought it, and the lord Abraham
sacrificed it, saying, God is most great!</i> And We left
<i>this salutation</i> [to be bestowed] on him by the latter
generations, Peace [be] on Abraham! Thus do We reward
the well-doers: for he was of our believing servants.</p>

<p class="name">(xxxvii. 97-111.)</p>

<p><i>Remember</i> when Abraham said, O my Lord, show me
how Thou will raise to life the dead.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a>&mdash;He said, Hast thou
not believed? He answered, Yea: but <i>I have asked Thee</i>
that my heart may be at ease. He replied, Then take
four birds and draw them towards thee, <i>and cut them in
pieces and mingle together their flesh and their feathers</i>;
then place upon each mountain <i>of thy land</i> a portion of
them, then call them <i>unto thee</i>: they shall come unto
thee quickly: and know thou that God is mighty [and]
wise.&mdash;<i>And he took a peacock and a vulture and a raven
and a cock, and did with them as hath been described, and
kept their heads with him, and called them; whereupon the
portions flew about, one to another, until they became complete:
then they came to their heads.</i></p>

<p class="name">(ii. 262.)</p>

<p><i>Remember</i> when his Lord had tried Abraham by
[certain] words, <i>commands and prohibitions</i>, and he fulfilled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>
them, <i>God</i> said <i>unto him</i>, I constitute thee a model
of religion unto men.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> He replied, And of my offspring
<i>constitute models of religion</i>. [God] said, My covenant
doth not apply to the offenders, <i>the unbelievers among them</i>.&mdash;And
when We appointed the house (<i>that is, the Ka&#7841;beh</i>)
to be a place for the resort of men, and a place of security
(<i>a man would meet the slayer of his father there and he
would not provoke him</i> [to revenge],) and [said], Take, <i>O
men</i>, the station of Abraham (<i>the stone upon which he stood
at the time of building the House</i>) as a place of prayer,
<i>that ye may perform behind it the prayers of the two rek&acute;ahs</i><a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a>
[which are ordained to be performed after the ceremony]
<i>of the circuiting</i> [of the Ka&#7841;beh].&mdash;And We commanded
Abraham and Ishmael, [saying], Purify my House (<i>rid it of
the idols</i>) for those who shall compass [it], and those who
shall abide <i>there</i>, and those who shall bow down and prostrate
themselves.&mdash;And when Abraham said, O my Lord,
make this <i>place</i> a secure territory (<i>and God hath answered
his prayer, and made it a sacred place, wherein the blood of
man is not shed, nor is any one oppressed in it, nor is its
game hunted</i> [or shot], <i>nor are its plants cut or pulled up</i>),
and supply its inhabitants with fruits <i>which hath been
done by the transporting of E&#7789;-&#7788;&aacute;&iuml;f from Syria thither, when
it</i> [that is, the territory of Mekkeh] <i>was desert, without sown
land or water</i>,<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> such of them as shall believe in God and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>
the last day.&mdash;<i>He mentioned them peculiarly in the prayer
agreeably with the saying of God, My covenant doth not
apply to the offenders.</i>&mdash;<i>God</i> replied, And <i>I will supply</i> him
who disbelieveth: I will make him to enjoy <i>a supply of
food in this world</i>, a little <i>while</i>: then I will force him, <i>in
the world to come</i>, to the punishment of the fire; and evil
shall be the transit.</p>

<p class="name">(ii. 118-120.)</p>

<p>And <i>remember</i> when Abraham was raising the foundations
of the House<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> (<i>that is, building it</i>), together with
Ishmael, <i>and they said</i>, O our Lord, accept of us <i>our building</i>;
for Thou art the Hearer <i>of what is said</i>, the Knower
<i>of what is done</i>. O our Lord, also make us resigned<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> unto
Thee, and <i>make</i> from among our offspring a people resigned
unto Thee, and show us our rites (<i>the ordinances of our
worship, or our pilgrimage</i>), and be propitious towards
us; for Thou art the Very Propitious, the Merciful.
(<i>They begged Him to be propitious to them, notwithstanding
their honesty, from a motive of humility, and by
way of instruction to their offspring.</i>) O our Lord, also send
unto them (<i>that is, the people of the House</i>) an apostle from
among them (<i>and God hath answered their prayer by sending
Mo&#7717;ammad</i>), who shall recite unto them Thy signs (the
&#7730;ur-&aacute;n), and shall teach them the book (<i>the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n</i>), and
the knowledge <i>that it containeth</i>, and shall purify them
<i>from polytheism</i>; for Thou art the Mighty, the Wise.&mdash;And
who will be averse from the religion of Abraham but
he who maketh his soul foolish, <i>who is ignorant that it is
God&#8217;s creation, and that the worship of Him is incumbent on
it; or who lightly esteemeth it and applieth it to vile purposes</i>;
when We have chosen him in this world <i>as an
apostle and a friend</i>, and he shall be in the world to come
one of the righteous <i>for whom are high ranks?&mdash;And</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
<i>remember</i> when his lord said unto him, Resign thyself:&mdash;he
replied, I resign myself unto the Lord of the worlds.&mdash;And
Abraham commanded his children to follow it (<i>namely,
the religion</i>); and Jacob,<i> his children; saying</i>, O my
children, verily God hath chosen for you the religion <i>of
El-Isl&aacute;m</i>;<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> therefore die not without your being Muslims.&mdash;<i>It
was a prohibition from abandoning El-Isl&aacute;m and a
command to persevere therein unto death.</i></p>

<p class="name">(ii. 121-126.)</p>

<p><i>When the Jews said, Abraham was a Jew, and we are of
his religion,&mdash;and the Christians said the like</i>, [the following]
<i>was revealed</i>:&mdash;O people of the Scripture, wherefore
do ye argue respecting Abraham, <i>asserting that he was of
your religion</i>, when the Pentateuch and the Gospel were
not sent down but after him <i>a long time</i>? Do ye not then
understand the <i>falsity of your saying</i>? So ye, O people,
have argued respecting that of which ye have knowledge,
<i>concerning Moses and Jesus, and have asserted that ye are of
their religion</i>: then wherefore do ye argue respecting that
of which ye have no knowledge, <i>concerning Abraham</i>?
But God knoweth <i>his case</i>, and ye know <i>it</i> not. Abraham
was not a Jew nor a Christian: but he was orthodox, a
Muslim [or one resigned], <i>a unitarian</i>, and he was not of
the polytheists.</p>

<h3><i>JACOB, JOSEPH AND HIS BRETHREN.</i></h3>

<p><i>Remember</i>, when Joseph [Yoosuf] said unto his father,
O my father, verily I saw <i>in sleep</i> eleven stars and the
sun and the moon: I saw them making obeisance unto me.
He replied, O my child, relate not thy vision to thy
brethren, lest they contrive a plot against thee, <i>knowing
its interpretation to be that they are the stars and that the
sun is thy mother and the moon thy father</i>; for the devil is
unto man a manifest enemy. And thus, <i>as thou sawest</i>, thy
Lord will choose thee, and teach thee the interpretation of
events, <i>or dreams</i>, and will accomplish his favour upon
thee <i>by the gift of prophecy</i>, and upon the family of Jacob,
as He accomplished it upon thy fathers before, Abraham
and Isaac; for thy Lord is knowing [and] wise.&mdash;Verily in
<i>the history of</i> Joseph and his brethren are signs to the
inquirers.&mdash;When they (<i>the brethren of Joseph</i>) said, <i>one to
another</i>, Verily Joseph and his brother <i>Benjamin</i> are dearer
unto our father than we, and we are a number of men;
verily our father is in a manifest error; slay ye Joseph, or
drive him away into a <i>distant</i> land; so the face of your
father shall be directed alone unto you, <i>regarding no other</i>,
and ye shall be after it a just people:&mdash;a speaker among
them, <i>namely, Judah</i>, said, Slay not Joseph, but throw
him to the bottom of the well; then some of the travellers
may light upon him, if ye do <i>this</i>. <i>And they were satisfied
therewith</i>. They said, O our father, wherefore dost thou
not intrust us with Joseph, when verily we are faithful
unto him? Send him with us tomorrow <i>into the plain</i>,
that he may divert himself and sport; and we will surely
take care of him.&mdash;He replied, Verily your taking him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>
away will grieve me, and I fear lest the wolf devour him
while ye are heedless of him. They said, Surely if the
wolf devour him, when we are a number of men, we shall
in that case be indeed weak. <i>So he sent him with them.</i>
And when they went away with him, and agreed to put
him at the bottom of the well, <i>they did so</i>.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> <i>They pulled
off his shirt, after they had beaten him and had treated him
with contempt and had desired to slay him; and they let
him down; and when he had arrived half-way down the well
they let him fall, that he might die; and he fell into the water.
He then betook himself to a mass of rock; and they called to
him; so he answered them, imagining that they would have
mercy upon him. They however desired to crush him with a
piece of rock; but Judah prevented them.</i> And We said
unto him by revelation, <i>while he was in the well (and he
was seventeen years of age, or less), to quiet his heart</i>, Thou
shalt assuredly declare unto them this their action, and
they shall not know <i>thee at the time</i>.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> And they came
to their father at nightfall weeping. They said, O our
father, we went to run races,<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> and left Joseph with our
clothes, and the wolf devoured him; and thou wilt not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span>
believe us, though we speak truth. And they brought
false blood upon his shirt. <i>Jacob</i> said <i>unto them</i>, Nay, your
minds have made a thing seem pleasant unto you, <i>and ye
have done it</i>;<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> but patience is seemly, and God&#8217;s assistance
is implored with respect to that which ye relate.</p>

<p>And travellers came <i>on their way from Midian (Medyen)
to Egypt, and alighted near the well</i>;<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> and they sent their
drawer of water,<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> and he let down his bucket <i>into the well:
so Joseph caught hold upon it, and the man drew him forth;
and when he saw him</i>, he said, O good news! This is a
young man!&mdash;<i>And his brethren thereupon knew his case;
wherefore they came unto him</i>, and they<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> concealed his case,
<i>making him</i> as a piece of merchandise; <i>for they said, He is
our slave who hath absconded. And Joseph was silent, fearing
lest they should slay him.</i> And God knew that which
they did. And they sold him for a mean price, [for] some
dirhems counted down, <i>twenty, or two-and-twenty</i>; and
they were indifferent to him. <i>The travellers then brought
him to Egypt, and he who had bought him sold him for twenty
deen&aacute;rs and a pair of shoes and two garments.</i> And the
Egyptian who bought him, <i>namely, &#7730;i&#7789;feer</i>,<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> said unto his
wife <i>Zeleekha</i>, Treat him hospitably; peradventure he may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>
be advantageous to us, or we may adopt him as a son.
<i>For he was childless.</i> And thus We prepared an establishment
for Joseph in the land <i>of Egypt</i>, to teach him the
interpretation of events, <i>or dreams</i>; for God is well able
to effect His purpose; but the greater number of men,
<i>namely, the unbelievers</i>, know not <i>this</i>. And when he had
attained his age of strength (<i>thirty years, or three-and-thirty</i>),
We bestowed on him wisdom and knowledge <i>in
matters of religion, before he was sent as a prophet</i>; for thus
do We recompense the well-doers. (xii. 4-22.&mdash;<i>Then follows
an account of his temptation by his mistress, Zeleekha.</i>)
</p>

<p>Then it seemed good unto them,<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> after they had seen
the signs of <i>his innocence, to imprison him</i>. They will
assuredly imprison him for a time, <i>until the talk of the people
respecting him cease</i>. <i>So they imprisoned him.</i> And there
entered with him into the prison two young men, <i>servants
of the king, one of whom was his cup-bearer and the other
was his victualler</i>. <i>And they found that he interpreted
dreams; wherefore</i> one of them, <i>namely, the cup-bearer</i>, said,
I dreamed that I was pressing grapes: and the other said,
I dreamed that I was carrying upon my head some bread,
whereof the birds did eat: acquaint us with the interpretation
thereof; for we see thee to be [one] of the beneficent.&mdash;He
replied, There shall not come unto you any food
wherewith ye shall be fed <i>in a dream</i>, but I will acquaint
you with the interpretation thereof <i>when ye are awake</i>,
before <i>the interpretation of</i> it come unto you. This is <i>a part</i>
of that which my Lord hath taught me. Verily I have
abandoned the religion of a people who believe not in God
and who disbelieve in the world to come; and I follow
the religion of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob.
It is not <i>fit</i> for us to associate anything with God. This
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span>
<i>knowledge of the unity</i> [hath been given us] of the bounty
of God towards us and towards mankind; but the greater
number of men are not thankful. O ye two companions
(<i>or inmates</i>) of the prison, are sundry lords better, or is
God, the One, the Almighty? Ye worship not, beside
Him, [aught] save names which ye and your fathers have
given <i>to idols</i>, concerning which God hath not sent down
any convincing proof. Judgment belongeth not [unto any]
save unto God <i>alone</i>. He hath commanded that ye worship
not [any] but Him. This is the right religion; but
the greater number of men know not. O ye two companions
of the prison, as to one of you, <i>namely, the cup-bearer</i>,
he will serve wine unto his lord <i>as formerly</i>; and
as to the other, he will be crucified, and the birds will eat
from off his head.&mdash;<i>Upon this they said, We dreamed not
aught.</i> <i>He replied</i>, The thing is decreed concerning which
ye [did] ask a determination, <i>whether ye have spoken truth
or have lied</i>. And he said unto him whom he judged to be
the person who should escape of them two, <i>namely the cup-bearer</i>,
Mention me unto thy Lord, <i>and say unto him, In
the prison is a young man imprisoned unjustly.&mdash;And he went
forth.</i> But the devil caused him to forget to mention
<i>Joseph</i> unto his lord:<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> so he remained in the prison some
years: <i>it is said, seven; and it is said, twelve.</i></p>

<p>And the king of <i>Egypt,<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> Er-Reiy&aacute;n the son of El-Weleed</i>
said, Verily I saw [in a dream] seven fat kine which seven
lean <i>kine</i> devoured, and seven green ears of corn and <i>seven</i>
other <i>ears</i> dried up. O ye nobles, explain unto me my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>
dream, if ye interpret a dream.&mdash;They replied, <i>These are</i>
confused dreams, and we know not the interpretation of
dreams. And he who had escaped, of the two <i>young men,
namely the cup-bearer</i>, said (for he remembered after a
time <i>the condition of Joseph</i>), I will acquaint you with the
interpretation thereof; wherefore send me. <i>So they sent
him; and he came unto Joseph, and said</i>, O Joseph, O thou
of great veracity, give us an explanation respecting seven
fat kine which seven lean [kine] devoured, and seven green
ears of corn and other [seven] dried up, that I may return
unto the men (<i>the king and his companions</i>), that they
may know <i>the interpretation thereof</i>. He replied, Ye shall
sow seven years as usual: (<i>this is the interpretation of the
seven fat kine</i>:) and what ye reap do ye leave in its ear,
<i>lest it spoil</i>; except a little, whereof ye shall eat. Then
there shall come, after that, seven grievous [years]: (<i>this is
the interpretation of the seven lean kine</i>:) they shall consume
what ye shall have provided for them, <i>of the grain
sown in the seven years of plenty</i>, except a little which ye
shall have kept. Then there shall come, after that, a year
wherein men shall be aided <i>with rain</i>, and wherein they
shall press <i>grapes and other fruits</i>.&mdash;And the king said,
<i>when the messenger came unto him and acquainted him with
the interpretation of the dream</i>, Bring unto me him <i>who
hath interpreted it</i>.</p>

<p class="name">(xii. 35-50.)</p>

<p>And when he had spoken unto him,<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> he said <i>unto him</i>,
Thou art this day firmly established with us, and intrusted
<i>with our affairs</i>. <i>What then seest thou fit for us to do?&mdash;He
answered, Collect provision, and sow abundant seed in</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
<i>these plentiful years, and store up the grain in its ear: then
the people will come unto thee that they may obtain provision
from thee.</i> <i>The king said, And who will act for me in this
affair?</i> <i>Joseph</i> said, Set me over the granaries of the
land; for I am careful [and] knowing.&mdash;Thus did We
prepare an establishment for Joseph in the land, that he
might take for himself a dwelling therein wherever he
pleased.&mdash;<i>And it is related that the king crowned him, and
put a ring on his finger, and instated him in the place of
&#7730;i&#7789;feer, whom he dismissed from his office; after which,
&#7730;i&#7789;feer died, and thereupon the king married him to his
wife Zeleekha, and she bore him two sons.</i><a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> We bestow Our
mercy on whom We please, and We cause not the reward
of the well-doers to perish: and certainly the reward of
the world to come is better for those who have believed
and have feared.</p>

<p><i>And the years of scarcity began, and afflicted the land
of Canaan and Syria</i>, and the brethren of Joseph came,
<i>except Benjamin, to procure provision, having heard that the
governor of Egypt gave food for its price</i>.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> And they went
in unto him, and he knew them; but they knew him not;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>
<i>and they spake unto him in the Hebrew language; whereupon
he said, as one who distrusted them, What hath brought
you to my country? So they answered, For corn. But he
said, Perhaps ye are spies. They replied, God preserve us</i>
[<i>from being spies</i>]! <i>He said, Then whence are ye? They
answered, From the land of Canaan, and our father is Jacob,
the prophet of God. He said, And hath he sons beside you?
They answered, Yea: we were twelve; but the youngest of
us went away, and perished in the desert, and he was the
dearest of us unto him; and his uterine brother remained,
and he retained him that he might console himself thereby for
the loss of the other.</i><a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> <i>And Joseph gave orders to lodge
them, and to treat them generously.</i> And when he had
furnished them with their provision, <i>and given them their
full measure</i>, he said, Bring me your brother from your
father, <i>namely, Benjamin, that I may know your veracity
in that ye have said</i>. Do ye not see that I give full measure,
and that I am the most hospitable of the receivers of guests?
But if ye bring him not, there shall be no measuring
<i>of corn</i> for you from me, nor shall ye approach me.&mdash;They
replied, We will solicit his father for him, and we
will surely perform <i>that</i>. And he said unto his young
men, Put their money,<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> <i>which they brought as the price of
the corn</i>, in their sacks, that they may know it when they
have returned to their family: peradventure they will
return <i>to us; for they will not deem it lawful to keep it</i>.&mdash;And
when they returned to their father, they said, O our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>
father, the measuring [of corn] is denied us <i>if thou send
not our brother unto him</i>; therefore send with us our
brother, that we may obtain measure; and we will surely
take care of him. He said, Shall I intrust you with him
otherwise than as I intrusted you with his brother
<i>Joseph</i> before? But God is the best guardian, and He is
the most merciful of those who show mercy.&mdash;And when
they opened their goods, they found their money had
been returned unto them. They said, O our father, what
desire we <i>of the, generosity of the king greater than this?</i>
This our money hath been returned unto us; and we
will provide corn for our family, and will take care of
our brother, and shall receive a camel-load more, <i>for
our brother</i>. This is a quantity easy <i>unto the king,
by reason of his munificence</i>.&mdash;He said, I will by no
means send him with you until ye give me a solemn
promise by God that ye will assuredly bring him back
unto me unless <i>an inevitable and insuperable impediment</i>
encompass you. <i>And they complied with this his desire.</i>
And when they had given him their solemn promise, he
said, God is witness of what we say. <i>And he sent him with
them</i>; and he said, O my sons, enter not <i>the city of Mi&#7779;r</i> by
one gate; but enter by different gates; <i>lest the</i> [evil] <i>eye
fall upon you</i>.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> But I shall not avert from you, <i>by my
saying this</i>, anything <i>decreed to befall you</i> from God: <i>I
only say this from a feeling of compassion.</i> Judgment
belongeth not [unto any] save unto God <i>alone</i>. On Him
do I rely, and on Him let those rely who rely.</p>

<p>And when they entered as their father had commanded
them, <i>separately</i>, it did not avert from them anything
<i>decreed to befall them</i> from God, but [only satisfied] a desire
in the soul of Jacob, which he accomplished; <i>that is, the</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
<i>desire of averting the</i> [evil] <i>eye, arising from a feeling of
compassion:</i> and he was endowed with knowledge, because
We had taught him: but the greater number of men,
<i>namely the unbelievers</i>, know not <i>God&#8217;s inspiration of His
saints</i>. And when they went in unto Joseph, he received
unto him (<i>or pressed unto him</i>) his brother. He said,
Verily I am thy brother;<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> therefore be not sorrowful for
that which they did <i>from envy to us</i>. <i>And he commanded
him that he should not inform them, and agree with him
that he should employ a stratagem to retain him with him.</i>
And when he had furnished them with their provision, he
put the cup, <i>which was a measure made of gold set with
jewels</i>,<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> in the sack of his brother <i>Benjamin</i>. Then a crier
cried, <i>after they had gone forth from the chamber of Joseph</i>,
O company of travellers, ye are surely thieves. They
said (and turned unto them), What is it that ye miss?
They answered, We miss the king&#8217;s measure; and to him
who shall bring it [shall be given] a camel-load <i>of corn</i>,
and I am surety for it, <i>namely the load</i>. They replied, By
God! ye well know that we have not come to act
corruptly in the land, and we have not been thieves.
<i>The crier and his companions said</i>, Then what shall be the
recompense of him <i>who hath stolen it</i>, if ye be liars <i>in your
saying, We have not been thieves,&mdash;and it be found among
you?</i> They answered, His recompense [shall be that] he
in whose sack it shall be found <i>shall be made a slave:</i> he,
<i>the thief</i>, shall be compensation for it; <i>namely, for the</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>
<i>thing stolen. Such was the usage of the family of Jacob.</i>
Thus do We recompense the offenders <i>who are guilty of
theft.&mdash;So they turned towards Joseph, that he might search
their sacks.</i> And he began with their sacks, <i>and searched
them</i> before the sack of his brother [Benjamin], <i>lest he
should be suspected</i>. Then he took it forth (<i>namely, the
measure</i>) from the sack of his brother. Thus, <i>saith God</i>,
did We contrive a stratagem for Joseph. It was not [lawful]
for him to take his brother <i>as a slave for theft</i> by the
law of the king of <i>Egypt</i> (<i>for his recompense by his law
was beating, and a fine of twice the value of the thing stolen;
not the being made a slave</i>), unless God had pleased, <i>by
inspiring him to inquire of his brethren and inspiring them
to reply according to their usage</i>. We exalt unto degrees
[of knowledge and honour] whom We please, <i>as Joseph</i>;
and [there is who is] knowing above every one [else]
endowed with knowledge.&mdash;They said, If he steal, a
brother of his hath stolen before; <i>namely, Joseph;<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> for he
stole an idol of gold belonging to the father of his mother,
and broke it, that he might not worship it.</i> And Joseph
concealed it in his mind, and did not discover it to them.
He said <i>within himself</i>, Ye are in a worse condition <i>than
Joseph and his brother, by reason of your having stolen your
brother from your father and your having treated him
unjustly</i>; and God well knoweth what ye state <i>concerning
him</i>.&mdash;They said, O prince, verily he hath a father, a very
old man, <i>who loveth him more than us, and consoleth himself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
by him for the loss of his son who hath perished, and
the separation of him grieveth him</i>; therefore take one of
us <i>as a slave</i> in his stead; for we see thee [to be one] of
the beneficent. He replied, God preserve us from taking
[any] save him in whose possession we found our property;
for then (<i>if we took another</i>), we [should be]
unjust.</p>

<p>And when they despaired of [obtaining] him, they
retired to confer privately together. The chief of them
<i>in age</i> (<i>namely, Reuben, or in judgment, namely, Judah</i>),
said, Do ye not know that your father hath obtained of
you a solemn promise in the name of God, <i>with respect of
your brother</i>, and how ye formerly failed of your duty
with respect to Joseph? Therefore I will by no means
depart from the land <i>of Egypt</i> until my father give me
permission <i>to return to him</i>, or God decide for me <i>by the
delivery of my brother</i>; and He is the best, <i>the most just</i>,
of those who decide. Return ye to your father, and say,
O our father, verily thy son hath committed theft, and
we bore not testimony <i>against him</i> save according to that
which we knew <i>of a certainty, by our seeing the cup in his
sack</i>; and we were not acquainted with what was unseen
<i>by us when we gave the solemn promise: had we known
that he would commit theft, we had not taken him. And
send thou</i>, and ask <i>the people of</i> the city in which we have
been (<i>namely, Mi&#7779;r</i>)<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> and the company of travellers with
whom we have arrived (<i>who were a people of Canaan</i>):
and we are surely speakers of truth.&mdash;<i>So they returned to
him, and said unto him those words</i>. He replied, Nay,
your minds have made a thing seem pleasant unto you,
<i>and ye have done it</i> (<i>he suspected them, on account of their
former conduct in the case of Joseph</i>); but patience is
seemly: peradventure God will bring them back (<i>namely,
Joseph and his brother</i>) unto me, together; for He is
the Knowing <i>with respect to my case</i>, the Wise <i>in His</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
<i>acts</i>. And he turned from them, and said, O! my sorrow
for Joseph! And his eyes became white in consequence
of mourning, and he was oppressed with silent grief.
They said, By God, thou wilt not cease to think upon
Joseph until thou be at the point of death, or be of [the
number of] the dead. He replied, I only complain of my
great and unconcealable grief and my sorrow unto God;
<i>not unto any beside Him; for He it is unto whom complaint
is made with advantage</i>; and I know [by revelation] from
God what ye know not; <i>namely, that the dream of Joseph
was true, and that he is living</i>. <i>Then he said</i>, O my sons,
go and seek news of Joseph and his brother; and despair
not of the mercy of God; for none despaireth of the
mercy of God except the unbelieving people.</p>

<p><i>So they departed towards Egypt, unto Joseph</i>; and when
they went in unto him, they said, O Prince, distress (<i>that
is, hunger</i>) hath affected us and our family, and we have
come with paltry money (<i>it was base money, or some other
sort</i>): yet give us full measure, and be charitable to us, <i>by
excusing the badness of our money</i>; for God recompenseth
those who act charitably. <i>And he had pity upon them,
and compassion affected him, and he lifted up the curtain
that was between him and them: then</i> he said <i>unto them in
reproach</i>, Do ye know what ye did unto Joseph, <i>in beating
and selling and other actions</i>, and his brother, <i>by your
injurious conduct to him after the separation of his brother</i>,
when ye were ignorant <i>of what would be the result of the
case of Joseph?</i><a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> They replied, <i>after they had recognised
him (desiring confirmation)</i>, Art thou indeed Joseph? He
answered, I am Joseph, and this is my brother. God hath
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
been gracious unto us, <i>by bringing us together</i>; for whosoever
feareth <i>God</i> and is patient [will be rewarded]: God
will not suffer the reward of the well-doers to perish.
They replied, By God, verily God hath preferred thee
above us, and we have been indeed sinners. He said,
[There shall be] no reproach [cast] on you this day: God
forgive you; for He is the most merciful of those that
show mercy. <i>And he asked them respecting his father: so
they answered, His eyes are gone.</i> <i>And he said</i>, Go ye with
this my shirt (<i>it was the shirt of Abraham, which he wore
when he was cast into the fire: it was on his</i> [that is,
Joseph&#8217;s] <i>neck</i> [appended as an amulet] <i>in the well; and
it was from paradise: Gabriel commanded him to send it,
and said, In it is its odour</i> [that is, the odour of paradise],
<i>and it shall not be cast upon any one afflicted</i> [with a
disease] <i>but he shall be restored to health</i>), and cast it [said
Joseph] upon the face of my father: he shall recover his
sight; and bring unto me all your family.&mdash;And when
the company of travellers had gone forth <i>from El-&acute;Areesh<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> of
Egypt</i>, their father said, <i>unto those who were present of his
offspring</i>, Verily I perceive the smell of Joseph (<i>for the
zephyr had conveyed it to him, by permission of Him whose
name be exalted, from the distance of three days&#8217; journey, or
eight, or more</i>): were it not that ye think I dote, <i>ye would
believe me.</i> They replied, By God, thou art surely in
thine old error. And when the messenger of good tidings
(<i>namely, Judah</i>) came <i>with the shirt</i> (<i>and he had borne the
bloody shirt; wherefore he desired to rejoice him, as he
had grieved him</i>), he cast it upon his face, and he recovered
his sight. [Thereupon Jacob] said, Did I not say unto
you, I know, from God, what ye know not? They said,
O our father, ask pardon of our crimes for us; for we have
been sinners. He replied, I will ask pardon for you of
my Lord; for He is the Very forgiving, the Merciful.&mdash;<i>He
delayed doing so until the first appearance of the dawn</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
<i>that the prayer might be more likely to be answered; or, as
some say, until the night of</i> [that is, preceding] <i>Friday</i>.</p>

<p><i>They then repaired to Egypt, and Joseph and the great
men came forth to meet them</i>; and when they went in unto
Joseph, <i>in his pavilion or tent</i>, he received unto him (<i>or
pressed unto him</i>) his parents (<i>his father and his mother

if God please, in safety.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> <i>So they entered; and Joseph
seated himself upon his couch</i>, and he caused his parents to
ascend upon the seat of state, and they (<i>that is, his parents
and his brethren</i>) fell down, bowing themselves unto him<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a>
(<i>bending, but not putting the forehead</i>) [upon the ground]:
<i>such being their mode of obeisance in that time</i>. And he
said, O my father, this is the interpretation of my dream
of former times: my Lord hath made it true; and He hath
shown favour unto me, since He took me forth from the
prison (<i>he said not, from the well,&mdash;from a motive of generosity,
that his brethren might not be abashed</i>), and hath
brought you from the desert, after that the devil had
excited discord between me and my brethren; for my
Lord is gracious unto whom He pleaseth; for He is the
Knowing, the Wise.&mdash;<i>And his father resided with him four
and twenty years, or seventeen; and the period of his separation
was eighteen, or forty, or eighty years. And death
came unto him; and thereupon he charged Joseph that he
should carry him and bury him by his fathers. So he went
himself and buried him. Then he returned to Egypt and
remained after him three and twenty years; and when his
case was ended, and he knew that he should not last</i> [upon
earth], <i>and his soul desired the lasting possession, he said</i>, O
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
my Lord, Thou hast given me dominion, and taught me
the interpretation of events (<i>or dreams</i>): Creator of the
heavens and the earth, Thou art my guardian in this
world and in the world to come. Make me to die a
Muslim, and join me with the righteous <i>among my forefathers.
And he lived after that a week, or more, and died
a hundred and twenty years old. And the Egyptians disputed
concerning his burial: so they put him in a chest of
marble, and buried him in the upper part of the Nile, that
the blessing</i> [resulting from him] <i>might be general to the
tracts on each side of it.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> Extolled be the perfection of Him
to whose dominion there is no end!</i></p>

<h3><i>JOB.</i></h3>

<p>And remember Our servant Job [Eiyoob<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a>] when he
called unto his Lord, Verily the devil hath afflicted me
with calamity and pain. (<i>The affliction is attributed to the
devil, though all was from God.</i>) <i>And it was said unto
him</i>, Strike <i>the earth</i> with thy foot. <i>And he did so;
whereupon a fountain of water sprang forth.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> And it was
said</i>, This <i>is</i> cool <i>water for thee</i> to wash with, and to drink.
<i>So he washed himself and drank; and every disease that he
had, external and internal, quitted him.</i> And We gave
unto him his family, and as many more with them (<i>that is,
God raised to life for him those of his children who had
died, and blest him with as many more</i>),<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> in Our mercy and as
an admonition unto those who are endowed with faculties
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
of understanding. [And We said unto him,] Take in thy
hand a handful <i>of dry grass, or of twigs</i>,<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> and strike with
it <i>thy wife</i> (<i>for he had sworn that he would inflict upon her
a hundred blows, because she had staid away from him too
long one day</i><a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a>) and break not thine oath <i>by abstaining from
striking her.</i>&mdash;<i>So he took a hundred stalks of schoemanthus,
or some other plant, and gave her one blow with them.</i>
Verily We found him a patient person. How excellent
a servant <i>was he</i>! For he was one who earnestly turned
himself unto God.</p>

<h3><i>SHO&acute;EYB.</i></h3>

<p>And <i>we sent</i> unto Midian [Medyen] their brother
Sho&acute;eyb.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> He said, O my people, worship God; <i>assert
His unity</i>. Ye have no other deity but Him. And give
not short measure and weight. Verily I see you [to be]
in a state of prosperity <i>that placeth you above the need of
doing so</i>; and verily I fear for you, <i>if ye believe not</i>, the
punishment of a day that will encompass <i>you with destruction</i>.
And, O my people, give full measure and weight
with equity; and diminish not unto men <i>aught</i> of their
things nor commit injustice in the earth, acting corruptly,
<i>by murder or other offences</i>. The residue of God (<i>His supply
that remaineth to you after the completion of the measure</i>)
will be better for you <i>than diminution</i>, if ye be believers.
And I am not a guardian over you, <i>to recompense you for
your actions: I have only been sent as an admonisher</i>.&mdash;They
replied, <i>in mockery</i>, O Sho&acute;eyb, do thy prayers command
thee that we are to leave what our fathers worshipped,
or <i>cease</i> to do with our riches what we please?
Verily thou art the mild, the right director. <i>This they
said in mockery.</i>&mdash;He said, O my people, tell me, if I act
according to an evident proof from my Lord, and He hath
supplied me with a good <i>lawful</i> provision, shall I mix it
up with what is forbidden, and shall I not desire to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span>
oppose you, <i>and shall I betake myself</i> to that which I forbid
you? I desire not [aught] but <i>your</i> reformation, as
far as I am able [to effect it], and my help is not [in any]
but in God: on Him do I rely, and unto Him do I turn
me. And, O my people, let not the opposition of me procure
for you the befalling you of the like of that which
befell the people of Noah or the people of Hood or the
people of &#7778;&aacute;li&#7717;. And <i>the abodes of the</i> people of Lot [are]
not distant from you: (<i>or the time of their destruction was
not long ago:</i>) <i>therefore be admonished</i>. And ask ye forgiveness
of your Lord, and turn unto Him with repentance;
for my Lord is merciful <i>to the believers</i>, loving <i>to them</i>.
They replied, O Sho&acute;eyb, we understand not much of what
thou sayest, and verily we see thee to be weak<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> among
us; and were it not for thy family, we had stoned thee;
for thou art not, in our estimation, an honourable person:
<i>thy family only are the honourable</i>. He said, O my people,
are my family more honourable in your estimation than
God, <i>and do ye abstain from slaying me for their sake, and
not preserve me for God</i>, and have ye cast Him behind you
as a thing neglected? Verily my Lord comprehendeth
that which ye do, <i>and He will recompense you</i>. And, O
my people, act ye according to your condition: verily I
will act <i>according to mine</i>. Ye shall know on whom shall
come a punishment that shall render him vile, and who is
a liar: and await ye <i>the issue of your case</i>: verily I await
with you.&mdash;And when Our degree <i>for their destruction</i>
came [to be executed], we delivered Sho&acute;eyb and those
who believed with him, in our mercy, and the cry <i>of
Gabriel</i> assailed those who had offended, so that in the
morning they were in their abodes prostrate <i>and dead</i>, as
though they had not dwelt therein. Was not Midian
removed as Thamood had been removed?</p>

<h3><i>MOSES AND HIS PEOPLE.</i></h3>

<p>We will rehearse unto thee, [O Mo&#7717;ammad, somewhat]
of the history of Moses [Moos&aacute;] and Pharaoh [Fir&acute;own
or Far&acute;oon],<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> with truth, for <i>the sake of</i> people who believe.
Verily Pharaoh exalted himself in the land <i>of
Egypt</i>, and divided its inhabitants into parties <i>to serve
him</i>. He rendered weak one class of them, <i>namely the
children of Israel</i>, slaughtering their male children, and
preserving alive their females, <i>because one of the diviners
said unto him, A child will be born among the children
of Israel, who will be the means of the loss of thy kingdom;</i>&mdash;for
he was [one] of the corrupt doers. And We
desired to be gracious unto those who had been deemed
weak in the land, and to make them models of religion,
and to make them the heirs <i>of the possessions of Pharaoh</i>,
and to establish them in the land <i>of Egypt, and in Syria</i>,
and to show Pharaoh and H&aacute;m&aacute;n<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> and their forces what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
they feared from them. And We said, by revelation, unto
the mother of Moses, <i>the child above-mentioned, of whose
birth none knew save his sister</i>, Suckle him; and when thou
fearest for him cast him in the river <i>Nile</i>, and fear not <i>his
being drowned</i>, nor mourn <i>for his separation</i>; for We will
restore him unto thee, and will make him [one] of the
apostles.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> <i>So she suckled him three months, during which
he wept not; and then she feared for him, wherefore she put
him into an ark pitched within and furnished with a bed
for him, and she closed it and cast it in the river Nile by
night.</i> And the family (<i>or servants</i>) of Pharaoh lighted
upon him <i>in the ark on the morrow of that night</i>;<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> <i>so they
put it before him, and it was opened, and Moses was taken
forth from it, sucking milk from his thumb:</i> [this happened]
that he might be unto them <i>eventually</i> an enemy (<i>slaying
their men</i>) and an affliction (<i>making slaves of their women</i>);
for Pharaoh and H&aacute;m&aacute;n (<i>his Wezeer</i>) and their forces were
sinners; <i>wherefore they were punished by his hand</i>. And the
wife of Pharaoh said, <i>when he and his servants had proposed
to kill him</i>, He <i>is</i> delight of the eye unto me and unto
thee: do not ye kill him: peradventure he may be serviceable
unto us, or we may adopt him as a son. <i>And</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span><i>
they complied with her desire</i>; and they knew not <i>the consequence</i>.</p>

<p>And the heart of the mother of Moses, <i>when she knew of
his having been lighted upon</i>, became disquieted; and she
had almost made him known <i>to be her son</i>, had We not
fortified her heart with patience, that she might be [one]
of the believers <i>in Our promise</i>. And she said unto his
sister <i>Maryam</i> [or Mary], Trace him, <i>that thou mayest
know his case</i>. And she watched him from a distance,
while they knew not <i>that she was his sister and that she was
watching him</i>. And We forbade him the breasts, <i>preventing
him from taking the breast of any nurse except his mother</i>,
before <i>his restoration to her</i>: so <i>his sister</i> said, Shall I
direct you unto the people of a house who will nurse him
for you, and who will be faithful unto him? <i>And her
offer was accepted; therefore she brought his mother, and he
took her breast: so she returned with him to her house, as
God hath said</i>,&mdash;And We restored him to his mother, that
her eye might be cheerful and that she might not grieve,
and that she might know that the promise of God <i>to restore
him unto her</i> was true: but the greater number of them (<i>that
is, of mankind</i>) know not <i>this</i>. <i>And it appeared not that
this was his sister and this his mother; and he remained
with her until she had weaned him; and her hire was paid
her, for every day a deen&aacute;r, which she took</i> [without
scruple] <i>because it was the wealth of a hostile person. She
then brought him unto Pharaoh, and he was brought up in
his abode, as God hath related of him in the Chapter of the
Poets,</i><a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> [where Pharaoh said unto Moses,] <i>Have we not
brought thee up among us a child, and hast thou not dwelt
among us</i> [thirty] <i>years of thy life?</i></p>

<p>And when he had attained his age of strength (<i>thirty
years or thirty and three</i>), and had become of full age
(<i>forty years</i>), We bestowed on him wisdom and knowledge
<i>in religion, before he was sent as a prophet</i>; and thus do
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span>
We reward the well-doers. And he entered the city <i>of
Pharaoh, which was Munf</i> [or Memphis], <i>after he had
been absent from him a while</i>, at a time when its inhabitants
were inadvertent, <i>at the hour of the noon-sleep</i>, and
he found therein two men fighting; this [being] of his
party (<i>namely an Israelite</i>), and this of his enemies (<i>an
Egyptian</i>), <i>who was compelling the Israelite to carry firewood
to the kitchen of Pharaoh without pay</i>: and he who
was of his party begged him to aid him against him who
was of his enemies. <i>So Moses said unto the latter, Let him
go. And it is said that he replied to Moses, I have a mind
to put the burden upon thee.</i> And Moses struck him with
his fist, and killed him. <i>But he intended not to kill him;
and he buried him in the sand.</i> He said, This is of the work
of the devil, <i>who hath excited my anger</i>; for he is an
enemy <i>unto the son of Adam</i>, a manifest misleader <i>of him</i>.
He said, <i>in repentance</i>, O my Lord, verily I have acted
injuriously unto mine own soul, <i>by killing him</i>; therefore
forgive me. So He forgave him: for He is the Very
Forgiving, the Merciful.&mdash;He said, O my Lord, by the
favours with which Thou hast favoured me, <i>defend me</i>, and
I will by no means be an assistant to the sinners <i>after
this</i>.&mdash;And the next morning he was afraid in the city,
watching <i>for what might happen unto him on account of
the slain man</i>; and lo, he who had begged his assistance
the day before was crying out to him for aid <i>against
another Egyptian</i>. Moses said unto him, Verily thou art
a person manifestly in error, <i>because of that which thou
hast done yesterday and to-day</i>. But when he was about
to lay violent hands upon him who was an enemy unto
them both, (<i>namely unto Moses and him who begged his aid</i>,)
<i>the latter</i> said, <i>imagining that he would lay violent hands
upon him, because of that which he had said unto him</i>, O
Moses, dost thou desire to kill me, as thou killedst a soul
yesterday? Thou desirest not [aught] but to be an
oppressor in the land, and thou desirest not to be [one]
of the reconcilers.&mdash;<i>And the Egyptian heard that: so he</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span>
<i>knew that the killer was Moses; wherefore he departed unto
Pharaoh and acquainted him therewith, and Pharaoh
commanded the executioners to slay Moses, and they betook
themselves to seek him.</i> But a man <i>who was a believer of
the family of Pharaoh</i><a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> came from the furthest part of the
city, running <i>by a way that was nearer than the way by
which they had come</i>: he said, O Moses, verily the chiefs
<i>of the people of Pharaoh</i> are consulting respecting thee, to
slay thee; therefore go forth <i>from the city</i>: verily I am
unto thee [one] of the admonishers. So he went forth
from it in fear, watching <i>in fear of pursuer, or for the aid
of God</i>. He said, O my Lord, deliver me from the unjust
people <i>of Pharaoh</i>!<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a></p>

<p>And when he was journeying towards Medyen, <i>which
was the city of Sho&acute;eyb, eight days&#8217; journey from Mi&#7779;r (named
after Medyen the son of Abraham), and he knew not the way
unto it</i>, he said, Peradventure my Lord will direct me unto
the right way, <i>or the middle way. And God sent unto him
an angel, having in his hand a short spear; and he went
with him thither.</i><a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> And when he came unto the water
(<i>or well</i>) of Medyen, he found at it a company of men
watering <i>their animals</i>; and he found besides them two
women keeping away <i>their sheep from the water</i>. He said
<i>unto them</i> (<i>namely the two women</i>), What is the matter
with you <i>that ye water not</i>? They answered, We shall
not water until the pastors shall have driven away <i>their
animals</i>; and our father is a very old man, <i>who cannot
water the sheep</i>. And he watered for them <i>from another
well near unto them, from which he lifted a stone that none</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>
<i>could lift but ten persons.</i> Then he retired to the shade
<i>of an Egyptian thorn-tree on account of the violence of the
heat of the sun; and he was hungry</i>, and he said, O my
Lord, verily I am in need of the good <i>provision</i> which Thou
shalt send down unto me. <i>And the two women returned
unto their father in less time than they were accustomed to
do: so he asked them the reason thereof; and they informed
him of the person who had watered for them; whereupon he
said unto one of them, Call him unto me.</i></p>

<p>And one of them<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> came unto him, walking bashfully,
<i>with the sleeve of her shift over her face, by reason of her
abashment at him</i>: she said, My father calleth thee, that
he may recompense thee with the reward of thy having
watered for us. <i>And he assented to her call, disliking in
his mind the receiving of the reward: but it seemeth that she
intended the compensation if he were of such as desired it.
And she walked before him; and the wind blew her garment,
and her legs were discovered: so he said unto her, Walk
behind me and direct me in the way. And she did so, until
she came unto her father, who was Sho&acute;eyb, on whom be peace!
and with him was</i> [prepared] <i>a supper. He said unto him,
Sit and sup. But he replied, I fear lest it be a compensation
for my having watered for them, and we are a family who
seek not a compensation for doing good. He said, Nay, it is
my custom and hath been the custom of my fathers to entertain
the guest and to give food. So he ate; and acquainted,
him with his case.</i> And when he had come unto him, and
had related to him the story <i>of his having killed the
Egyptian and their intention to kill him and his fear of
Pharaoh</i>, he replied, Fear not: thou hast escaped from
the unjust people. (<i>For Pharaoh had no dominion over
Medyen.</i>) One of them [namely of the women] said
(<i>and she was the one who had been sent</i>), O my father, hire
him <i>to tend our sheep in our stead</i>; for the best whom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span>
thou canst hire is the strong, the trustworthy. <i>So he
asked her respecting him, and she acquainted him with what
hath been above related, his lifting up the stone of the well,
and his saying unto her, Walk behind me;&mdash;and moreover,
that when she had come unto him, and he knew of her presence,
he hung down his head and raised it not.</i> He <i>therefore</i>
said, Verily I desire to marry thee unto one of these
my two daughters, on the condition that thou shalt be a
hired servant to me, <i>to tend my sheep</i>, eight years; and if
thou fulfil ten <i>years</i>, it shall be of thine own will; and I
desire not to lay a difficulty upon thee <i>by imposing as a
condition the ten years</i>: thou shalt find me, if God please,
[one] of the just, <i>who are faithful to their covenants</i>. He
replied, This [be the covenant] between me and thee:
whichever of the two terms I fulfil, there shall be no
injustice against me <i>by demanding an addition thereto</i>;
and God is witness of what we say. <i>And the marriage-contract
was concluded according to this; and Sho&acute;eyb
ordered his daughter to give unto Moses a rod wherewith to
drive away the wild beasts from his sheep: and the rods of
the prophets were in his possession; and the rod of Adam, of
the myrtle of paradise, fell into her hand; and Moses took
it, with the knowledge of Sho&acute;eyb.</i></p>

<p class="name">(xxviii. 21-28.)</p>

<p>Hath the history of Moses been related to thee? when
he saw fire,<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> <i>during his journey from Medyen, on his way
to Egypt</i>, and said unto his family, <i>or his wife</i>, Tarry ye
<i>here</i>; for I have seen fire: perhaps I may bring you a
brand from it, or find at the fire a guide <i>to direct me in the
way. For he had missed the way in consequence of the
darkness of the night.</i> And when he came unto it (<i>and it</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg&nbsp;104]</a></span>
<i>was a bramble-bush</i>), he was called to [by a voice saying],
O Moses, verily I am thy Lord; therefore pull off thy
shoes;<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> for thou art in the holy valley of &#7788;uwa. And I
have chosen thee <i>from among thy people</i>; wherefore
hearken attentively unto that which is revealed <i>unto thee
by Me</i>. Verily I am God: there is no Deity except Me;
therefore worship Me, and perform prayer in remembrance
of Me. Verily the hour is coming: I will manifest it <i>unto
mankind, and its nearness shall appear unto them by its
signs</i>, that every soul may be recompensed <i>therein</i> for its
good and evil work: therefore let not him who believeth
not in it, and followeth his lust, hinder thee from <i>believing
in</i> it, lest thou perish. And what is that in thy right
hand, O Moses?&mdash;He answered, It is my rod, whereon I
lean and wherewith I beat down leaves for my sheep <i>that
they may eat them</i>; and I have other uses for it, <i>as the carrying
of provision and the water-skin, and the driving away of
reptiles</i>. He said, Cast it down, O Moses. So he cast it
down; and lo, it was a serpent,<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> running along. <i>God</i>
said, Take it, and fear <i>it</i> not:<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> we will restore it to its
former state. <i>And he put his hand into its mouth; whereupon
it became again a rod.</i> [And God said,] And put thy
<i>right</i> hand to thy <i>left</i> arm-pit, <i>and take it forth</i>: it shall
come forth white, without evil, (<i>that is, without leprosy;
shining like the rays of the sun, dazzling the sight,</i>) as
another sign, that We may show thee the greatest of our
signs <i>of thine apostleship</i>. (<i>And when he desired to restore
his hand to its first state, he put it as before described, and
drew it forth.</i>) Go <i>as an apostle</i> unto Pharaoh <i>and those</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg&nbsp;105]</a></span>
<i>who are with him</i>; for he hath acted with exceeding
impiety <i>by arrogating to himself divinity</i>.&mdash;<i>Moses</i> said,
O my Lord, dilate my bosom, <i>that it may hear the message</i>,
and make my affair easy unto me, and loose the knot of
my tongue (<i>this had arisen from his having been burned in
his mouth by a live coal when he was a child</i>),<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> that they
may understand my speech <i>when I deliver the message</i>.
And appoint unto me a Wezeer of my family, <i>namely</i>
Aaron [H&aacute;roon] my brother. Strengthen my back by
him, and make him a colleague in my affair, that we may
glorify Thee much, and remember Thee much; for Thou
knowest us.</p>

<p>God replied, Thou hast obtained thy petition, O Moses,
and We have been gracious unto thee another time:
forasmuch as We revealed unto thy mother what was
revealed, <i>when she gave birth to thee and feared that
Pharaoh would kill thee among the others that were born</i>,
[saying,] Cast him into the ark, and then cast him, <i>in the
ark</i>, into the river <i>Nile</i>, and the river shall throw him on
the shore; then an enemy unto Me and an enemy unto
him (<i>namely Pharaoh</i>) shall take him. And I bestowed
on thee, <i>after he had taken thee</i>, love from Me, <i>that thou
mightest be loved by men, so that Pharaoh and all that saw
thee loved thee</i>; and that thou mightest be bred up in
Mine eye. [Also] forasmuch as thy sister <i>Maryam</i> went
<i>that she might learn what became of thee, after they had
brought nurses and thou hadst refused to take the breast
of any one of them</i>, and she said, Shall I direct you unto
one who will nurse him? (<i>whereupon her proposal was</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>
<i>accepted, and she brought his mother</i>): so We restored thee
to thy mother, that her eye might become cheerful and that
she might not grieve. And thou slewest a soul, <i>namely
the Copt in Egypt, and wast sorry for his slaughter, on
account of Pharaoh</i>, and We delivered thee from sorrow;
and We tried thee with <i>other</i> trial, <i>and delivered thee from
it</i>.<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> And thou stayedst <i>ten</i> years among the people of
Medyen, <i>after thou hadst come thither from Egypt, at the
abode of Sho&acute;eyb the prophet, and he married thee to his
daughter.</i> Then thou camest according to <i>My</i> decree, <i>as
to the time of thy mission, when thou hadst attained the age
of forty years</i>, O Moses; and I have chosen thee for
Myself. Go thou and thy brother<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> <i>unto the people</i>, with
My <i>nine</i> signs, and cease ye not to remember Me. Go ye
unto Pharaoh; for he hath acted with exceeding impiety,
<i>by arrogating to himself divinity</i>, and speak unto him with
gentle speech, <i>exhorting him to relinquish that conduct</i>:
peradventure he will consider, or will fear <i>God, and repent</i>.
(<i>The</i> [mere] <i>hope with respect to the two</i> [results is
expressed] <i>because of God&#8217;s knowledge that he would not
repent.</i>)&mdash;They replied, O our Lord, verily we fear that he
may be precipitately violent against us, <i>hastening to
punish us</i>, or that he may act with exceeding injustice
<i>towards us</i>. He said, Fear ye not; for I am with you: I
will hear and will see. Therefore go ye unto him, and
say, Verily we are the apostles of thy Lord: therefore
send with us the children of Israel <i>unto Syria</i>, and do not
afflict them, <i>but cease to employ them in thy difficult works,
such as digging and building and carrying the heavy
burden</i>. We have come unto thee with a sign from thy
Lord, <i>attesting our veracity in asserting ourselves apostles</i>:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span>
and peace be on him who followeth the right direction:&mdash;<i>that
is, he shall be secure from punishment</i>. Verily it hath
been revealed unto us that punishment [shall be inflicted]
upon him who chargeth with falsehood <i>that wherewith we
have come</i>, and turneth away <i>from it</i>.</p>

<p class="name">(xx. 8-50.)</p>

<p>Then We sent after them, <i>namely the apostles before
mentioned</i> [who were Sho&acute;eyb and his predecessors],
Moses, with Our signs unto Pharaoh and his nobles, and
they acted unjustly with respect to them, <i>disbelieving in
the signs</i>: but see what was the end of the corrupt doers.
And Moses said, O Pharaoh, verily I am an apostle from
the Lord of the worlds <i>unto thee</i>. <i>But he charged him with
falsehood: so he said, I am</i> right not to say of God aught
but the truth. I have come unto you with a proof from
your Lord: therefore send with me <i>to Syria</i> the children
of Israel.&mdash;<i>Pharaoh</i> said <i>unto him</i>, If thou hast come with
a sign <i>confirmatory of thy pretension</i>, produce it, if thou be
of those who speak truth, So he cast down his rod;
and lo, it was a manifest serpent.<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> And he drew forth
his hand <i>from his bosom</i>; and lo, it was white <i>and radiant</i>
unto the beholders.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> The nobles of the people of Pharaoh
said, Verily this is a knowing enchanter: he desireth to
expel you from your land. What then do ye command?&mdash;They
answered, Put off for a time him and his brother,
and send unto the cities collectors [of the inhabitants],
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg&nbsp;108]</a></span>
that they may bring unto thee every knowing enchanter.
And the enchanters came unto Pharaoh. They said,
Shall we surely have a reward if we be the party who
overcome? He answered, Yea; and verily ye shall be of
those who are admitted near [unto my person]. They
said, O Moses, either do thou cast down <i>thy rod</i>, or we
will cast down <i>what we have with us</i>. He replied, Cast ye.
And when they cast down <i>their cords and their rods</i>, they
enchanted the eyes of the men, <i>diverting them from the
true perception of them</i>; and they terrified them; <i>for they
imagined them to be serpents running</i>; and they performed
a great enchantment.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> And We spake by revelation unto
Moses, [saying,] Cast down thy rod. And lo, it swallowed
up what they had caused to appear changed.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> So the
truth was confirmed, and that which they had wrought
became vain; and they were overcome there, and were
rendered contemptible. And the enchanters cast themselves
down prostrate:<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> they said, We believe in the Lord of
the worlds, the Lord of Moses and Aaron. Pharaoh said,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>
Have ye believed in Him before I have given you
permission? Verily this is a plot that ye have contrived
in the city, that ye may cause its inhabitants to go forth
from it. But ye shall know <i>what shall happen unto you at
my hand</i>. I will assuredly cut off your hands and your
feet on the opposite sides&mdash;<i>the right hand of each and
his left foot</i>: then I will crucify you all.&mdash;They replied.
Verily unto our Lord shall we return, <i>after our death, of
whatever kind it be</i>; and thou dost not take vengeance on
us but because we believed in the signs of our Lord when
they came unto us. O our Lord, pour upon us patience,
and cause us to die Muslims!<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a></p>

<p class="name">(vii. 101-123.)</p>

<p>And Pharaoh said, Let me alone, that I may kill Moses,
(<i>for they had diverted him from killing him</i>,) and let him
call upon his Lord <i>to defend him from me</i>. Verily I fear
lest he change your religion, <i>and prevent your worshipping
me</i>, or that he may cause corruption to appear in the earth
(<i>that is, slaughter, and other offences</i>).&mdash;And Moses said
<i>unto his people, having heard this</i>, Verily I have recourse
for defence unto my Lord and your Lord from every
proud person who believeth not in the day of account.
And a man [who was] a believer, of the family of
Pharaoh (<i>it is said that he was the son of his paternal
uncle</i>,)<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> who concealed his faith, said, Will ye kill a man
because he saith, My Lord is God,&mdash;when he hath come
unto you with evident proofs from your Lord? And if
he be a liar, on him [will be] <i>the evil consequence of</i> his
lie; but if he be a speaker of truth, somewhat of that
<i>punishment with</i> which he threateneth you will befall you
<i>speedily</i>. Verily God directeth not him who is a transgressor,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg&nbsp;110]</a></span>
<i>or polytheist</i>, [and] a liar. O my people, ye have
the dominion to-day, being overcomers in the land <i>of
Egypt</i>; but who will defend us from the punishment of
God <i>if ye kill his favourite servants</i>, if it come unto us?<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a>&mdash;Pharaoh
said, I will not advise you to do [aught] save
what I see to be advisable, <i>which is, to kill Moses</i>; and I
will not direct you save into the right way. And he who
had believed said, O my people, verily I fear for you the
like of the day of the confederates,<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> the like of the condition
of the people of Noah and &acute;&Aacute;d and Thamood and
those who [have lived] after them: and God willeth not
injustice unto [His] servants. And, O my people, verily I
fear for you the day of calling (<i>that is, the day of resurrection,
when the people of Paradise and those of Hell shall
often call one to another</i>). On the day when ye shall turn
back <i>from the place of reckoning unto hell</i>, ye shall have no
protector against God. And he whom God shall cause to
err shall have no director. Moreover, Joseph (<i>who was
Joseph the son of Jacob according to one opinion, and who
lived unto the time of Moses; and Joseph the son of
Abraham the son of Joseph the son of Jacob, according to
another opinion</i>) came unto you before <i>Moses</i>, with evident
<i>miraculous</i> proofs; but ye ceased not to be in doubt respecting
that wherewith he came unto you, until, when
he died, ye said <i>without proof</i> God will by no means
send an apostle after him. Thus God causeth to err him
who is a transgressor, <i>or polytheist</i>, [and] a sceptic. They
who dispute respecting the signs of God, without any
convincing proof having come unto them, <i>their disputing</i>
is very hateful with God and with those who have believed.
Thus God sealeth every heart (<i>or the whole heart</i>)
of a proud contumacious person.</p>

<p>And Pharaoh said, O H&aacute;m&aacute;n, build for me a tower,
that I may reach the avenues, the avenues of the heavens,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg&nbsp;111]</a></span>
and ascend unto the God of Moses;<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> but verily I think
him, <i>namely Moses</i>, a liar <i>in his assertion that he hath any
god but myself</i>. And thus the wickedness of his deed was
made to seem comely unto Pharaoh, and he was turned
away from the path <i>of rectitude</i>; and the artifice of
Pharaoh [ended] not save in loss. And he who had
believed said, O my people, follow me: I will direct you
into the right way. O my people, this present life is only
a temporary enjoyment; but the world to come is the
mansion of firm continuance. Whosoever doeth evil, he
shall not be recompensed save with the like of it; and
whosoever doeth good, whether male or female, and is a
believer, these shall enter Paradise; they shall be provided
for therein without reckoning. And, O my people,
how is it that I invite you unto salvation, and ye invite
me unto the Fire? Ye invite me to deny God, and to
associate with Him that of which I have no knowledge;
but I invite you unto the Mighty, the Very Forgiving.
[There is] no doubt but that the [false gods] <i>to the worship
of</i> which ye invite me are not to be invoked in this world,
nor in the world to come, and that our return [shall be]
unto God, and that the transgressors [shall be] the companions
of the Fire. And ye shall remember, <i>when ye see
the punishment</i>, what I say unto you; and I commit my
case unto God; for God seeth [His] servants.&mdash;<i>This he said
when they threatened him for his opposing their religion.</i>
Therefore God preserved him from the evils which they
had artfully devised (<i>namely slaughter</i>), and a most evil
punishment encompassed the people of Pharaoh,<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> <i>with</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg&nbsp;112]</a></span>
<i>Pharaoh himself (namely the drowning); then</i> they shall
be exposed to the Fire morning and evening;<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> and on the
day when the hour [of judgment] shall come, <i>it shall be
said unto the angels</i>, Introduce the people of Pharaoh into
the most severe punishment.</p>

<p class="name">(xl. 27-49.)</p>

<p>And the nobles of the people of Pharaoh said <i>unto him</i>,
Wilt thou let Moses and his people go that they may act
corruptly in the earth, <i>by inviting to disobey thee</i>, and
leave thee and thy gods? (<i>For he had made for them little
idols for them to worship, and he said, I am your Lord and
their Lord;&mdash;and therefore he said, I am your Lord the
Most High.</i>) He answered, We will slaughter their male
children and will suffer their females to live: and verily
we shall prevail over them. <i>And thus they did unto
them; wherefore the children of Israel complained, and</i>
Moses said unto his people, Seek aid of God, and be
patient; for the earth belongeth unto God: He causeth
whomsoever He will of His servants to inherit it; and
the <i>prosperous</i> end is for those who fear <i>God</i>. They replied,
We have been afflicted before thou camest unto us
and since thou hast come unto us. He said, Perhaps
your Lord will destroy your enemy and cause you to
succeed [him] in the earth, and He will see how ye will
act <i>therein</i>.&mdash;And We had punished the family of Pharaoh
with dearth and with scarcity of fruits, that they might
be admonished <i>and might believe</i>. But when good betided
them, they said, This is ours:&mdash;<i>that is, we deserve it;&mdash;and
they were not grateful for it</i>; and if evil befell them,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg&nbsp;113]</a></span>
they ascribed it to the ill luck of Moses and those <i>believers</i>
who were with him. Nay, their ill luck was only with
God: <i>He brought it upon them</i>: but the greater number of
them know not <i>this</i>. And they said <i>unto Moses</i>, Whatsoever
sign thou bring unto us, to enchant us therewith,
we will not believe in thee. <i>So he uttered an imprecation
upon them</i>, and We sent upon them the flood, <i>which
entered their houses and reached to the throats of the persons
sitting, seven days</i>,<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> and the locusts, <i>which ate their corn and
their fruits</i>, and the &#7731;ummal, <i>or grubs, or a kind of tick,
which sought after what the locusts had left</i>, and the frogs,
<i>which filled their houses and their food</i>, and the blood <i>in
their waters</i>; distinct signs: but they were proud, <i>refusing
to believe in them</i>, and were a wicked people. And when
the punishment fell upon them, they said, O Moses, supplicate
for us thy Lord, according to that which He hath
covenanted with thee, <i>namely that He will withdraw from
us the punishment if we believe</i>: verily, if thou remove
from us the punishment, we will assuredly believe thee,
and we will assuredly send with thee the children of
Israel. But when We removed from them the punishment
until a period at which they should arrive, lo, they brake
their promise. Wherefore We took vengeance on them,
and drowned them in the sea, because they charged our
signs with falsehood and were heedless of them. And We
caused the people who had been rendered weak, <i>by being
enslaved</i>, to inherit the eastern parts of the earth and its
western parts,<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> which we blessed <i>with water and trees,
(namely Syria)</i>; and the gracious word of thy Lord was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg&nbsp;114]</a></span>
fulfilled on the children of Israel, because they had
been patient; and We destroyed the <i>structures</i> which
Pharaoh and his people had built and what they had
erected.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a></p>

<p class="name">(vii. 124-133.)</p>

<p>We brought the children of Israel across the sea, and
Pharaoh and his troops pursued them with violence and
hostility, until, when drowning overtook him, he said, I
believe that there is no deity but He in whom the children
of Israel believe, and I am [one] of the Muslims.
<i>But Gabriel thrust into his mouth some of the mire of the
sea, lest mercy should be granted him, and said</i>, Now <i>thou
believest</i>, and thou hast been rebellious hitherto, and wast
[one] of the corrupters. But to-day we will raise thee
with thy lifeless body <i>from the sea</i>, that thou mayest be a
sign unto those [who shall come] after thee. (<i>It is related,
on the authority of Ibn-&acute;Abb&aacute;s, that some of the children of
Israel doubted his death; wherefore he was brought forth to
them that they might see him.</i>)<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> But verily many men are
heedless of Our signs.</p>

<p class="name">(x. 90-92.)</p>

<p>And We brought the children of Israel across the sea;
and they came unto a people who gave themselves up to
<i>the worship of</i> idols belonging to them;<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> [whereupon] they
said, O Moses, make for us a god (<i>an idol for us to worship</i>),
like as they have gods. He replied, Verily ye are
a people who are ignorant, <i>since ye have requited God&#8217;s
favour towards you with that which ye have said</i>; for that
[religion] in which these are [occupied shall be] destroyed,
and vain is that which they do. He said, Shall I seek for
you any other deity than God, when He hath preferred
you above the peoples <i>of your time</i>?</p>

<p class="name">(vii. 134-136.)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg&nbsp;115]</a></span></p>

<p>And We caused the thin clouds to shade you <i>from the
heat of the sun in the desert</i>, and caused the manna and the
quails<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> to descend upon you, <i>and said</i>, Eat of the good
things which We have given you for food, <i>and store not
up.&mdash;But they were ungrateful for the benefit, and stored
up; wherefore it was cut off from them</i>. And they injured
not Us <i>thereby</i>; but they did injure their own
souls.</p>

<p class="name">(ii. 54.)</p>

<p>[Remember, O children of Israel,] when ye said, O
Moses, we will not bear patiently the having one <i>kind of</i>
food, <i>the manna and the quails</i>; therefore supplicate for
us thy Lord, that He may produce for us <i>somewhat</i> of that
which the earth bringeth forth, of its herbs and its cucumbers
and its wheat and its lentils and its onions:&mdash;he
said <i>unto them</i>, Will ye take in exchange that which is
worse for that which is better?&mdash;<i>But they refused to
recede; therefore he supplicated God, and He said</i>, Get ye
down into a great city;<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> for ye shall have <i>therein</i> what
ye have asked.&mdash;And the <i>marks of</i> abjection and poverty
were stamped upon them: <i>so these characteristics necessarily
belong to them, even if they are rich, as necessarily as the
stamped coin belongeth to its die</i>; and they returned with
indignation from God. This was because they did disbelieve
in the signs of God, and slay the prophets (<i>as
Zechariah and John</i>) unjustly: this was because they
rebelled and did transgress.</p>

<p class="name">(ii. 58.)</p>

<p>And <i>remember</i> when Moses asked drink for his people,
<i>who had become thirsty in the desert</i>, and We said, Strike
with thy rod the stone. (<i>It was the stone that fled away</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg&nbsp;116]</a></span>
<i>with his garment:<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> it was light, square, like the head of a
man, marble or kedhdh&aacute;n.</i><a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a>) <i>Accordingly he struck it</i>; and
there gushed out from it twelve fountains, <i>according to the
number of the tribes</i>, all men (<i>each tribe of them</i>) knowing
their drinking-place. <i>And We said unto them</i>, Eat ye and
drink of the supply of God, and commit not evil in the
earth, acting corruptly.</p>

<p class="name">(ii. 57.)</p>

<p><i>Remember</i> also when We obtained your bond <i>that ye
would do according to that which is contained in the Law</i>,
and <i>had</i> lifted up over you the mountain [namely Mount
Sinai], <i>pulled it up by the roots and raised it over you when
ye had refused to accept the Law, and We said</i>, Receive that
which We have given you, with resolution, and remember
that which is contained in it, <i>to do according thereto</i>: peradventure
ye will fear <i>the Fire, or acts of disobedience</i>.&mdash;Then
ye turned back after that; and had it not been for
the grace of God towards you and His mercy, ye had
certainly been of those who perish. And ye know those
of you who transgressed on the Sabbath, <i>by catching fish,
when We had forbidden them to do so</i> (<i>and they were the
people of Eyleh</i><a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a>,) and We said unto them, Be ye apes,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg&nbsp;117]</a></span>
driven away from the society of men.&mdash;<i>Thereupon they
became such, and they perished after three days.</i>&mdash;And We
made it (<i>namely that punishment</i>) an example unto those
who were contemporary with them and those who came
after them, and a warning to the pious.</p>

<p class="name">(ii. 60-62.)</p>

<p>And We appointed unto Moses thirty nights, <i>at the expiration
of which We would speak to him, on the condition of
his fasting during them; and they were</i> [the nights of the
month of] <i>Dhu-l-&#7730;a&#7841;deh; and he fasted during them: but,
when they were ended, he disliked the smell of his breath;
so he used a tooth-stick; whereupon God commanded him to
fast ten other nights, that He might speak to Him with the
odour of his breath,<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> as He whose name be exalted hath said</i>,&mdash;and
We completed them by [adding] ten <i>nights of Dhu-l-&#7716;ijjeh</i>:
so the stated time of his Lord was completed,
forty nights. And Moses said unto his brother Aaron, <i>at
his departure to the mountain for the private collocution</i>, Be
thou my deputy among my people, and act rightly, and
follow not the way of the corrupt doers <i>by agreeing with
them in acts of disobedience</i>. And when Moses came at
Our appointed time, and his Lord spake unto him <i>without
an intermediary</i>, he said, O my Lord, show me <i>Thyself</i>,
that I may see Thee. He replied, Thou shalt not see Me:
but look at the mountain, <i>which is stronger than thou</i>; and
if it remain firm in its place, then shalt thou see Me.
And when his Lord displayed Himself to the mountain
(<i>that is, when there appeared, of His light, half of the tip of
His little finger, as related in a tradition which El-&#7716;&aacute;kim
hath verified</i>), He reduced it to powder, <i>levelling it even
with the ground around it</i>; and Moses fell down in a
swoon. And when he recovered, he said, Extolled be Thy
perfection! I turn unto Thee repenting, and I am the
first of the believers <i>in my time</i>.&mdash;<i>God</i> said <i>unto him</i>, O
Moses, I have chosen thee above the people <i>of thy time</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span>
[by honouring thee] by My commissions and by My
speaking <i>unto thee</i>: therefore receive what I have given
thee, and be of those who are grateful. And We wrote for
him upon the tables of <i>the Law</i><a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> (<i>which were of the lote-tree
of Paradise, or of chrysolite, or of emerald; in number
seven, or ten</i>) an admonition concerning every <i>requisite</i>
matter <i>of religion</i>, and a distinct explanation of everything;
<i>and said</i>, Therefore receive it with resolution, and
command thy people to act according to the most excellent
[precepts] thereof.</p>

<p class="name">(vii. 138-142.)</p>

<p>And the people of Moses, after it (<i>that is, after his
departure for the private collocution</i>), made, of their ornaments
(<i>which they had borrowed of the people of Pharaoh</i>),
a corporeal calf<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> <i>which Es-S&aacute;miree cast for them,</i><a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> <i>and</i>
which lowed; <i>for he had the faculty of doing so in consequence
of their having put into its mouth some dust taken
from</i> [beneath] <i>the hoof of the horse of Gabriel; and they
took it as a god</i>. Did they not see that it spake not to
them, nor directed them in the way? They took it <i>as a
god</i>, and were offenders. But when they repented, and
saw that they had erred, <i>which was after the return of
Moses</i>, they said, Verily if our Lord do not have mercy
upon us and forgive us, we shall assuredly be of those
who perish.</p>

<p class="name">(vii. 146-148.)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg&nbsp;119]</a></span></p>

<p>And Moses returned unto his people<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> enraged <i>against
them</i>, exceedingly sorrowful. He said, O my people, did
not your Lord promise you a good <i>true</i> promise, <i>that He
would give you the Law?</i> But did the time of <i>my absence</i>
seem tedious to you, or did ye desire that indignation from
your Lord should befall you, and therefore did ye break
your promise to me, <i>and abstain from coming after one?</i>&mdash;They
answered, We did not break our promise to thee of
our own authority; but we were made to carry loads of
the ornaments of the people <i>of Pharaoh</i> (<i>which the children
of Israel had borrowed of them under pretence of</i> [requiring
them for] <i>a wedding, and which remained in their possession</i>),
and we cast them <i>into the fire, by order of Es-S&aacute;miree</i>.
And in like manner also Es-S&aacute;miree cast <i>their ornaments
which he had, and some of the dust which he had taken from
the traces of the hoofs of the horse of Gabriel;</i> and he produced
unto them a corporeal calf, <i>of flesh and blood</i>, which
lowed, <i>by reason of the dust, the property of which is to give
life to that into which it is put; and he had put it, after he
had moulded the calf, into its mouth</i>. And they (<i>namely,
Es-S&aacute;miree and his followers</i>) said, This is your god, and
the god of Moses; but he hath forgotten <i>his lord here, and
gone to seek him. God saith</i>, But did they not see that it
returned them not an answer, nor was able to cause them
hurt or profit? And Aaron had said unto them, before
<i>the return of Moses</i>, O my people, ye are only tried by it;
and verily your Lord is the Compassionate; therefore
follow me, <i>by worshipping Him</i>, and obey my command.
They replied, We will by no means cease to be devoted to
<i>the worship of</i> it until Moses return unto us. <i>Moses</i> said
<i>after his return</i>, O Aaron, what hindered thee, when thou
sawest that they had gone astray, from following me?
Hast thou then been disobedient to my command, <i>by
remaining among them who worshipped another than God</i>?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg&nbsp;120]</a></span>
&mdash;He answered, O son of my mother, seize me not by my
beard (<i>for he had taken hold of his beard with his left hand</i>),
nor by [the hair of] my head (<i>for he had taken hold of his
hair with his right hand, in anger</i>). Verily I feared lest
<i>if I followed thee (for a company of those who worshipped
the calf would inevitably have followed me)</i> thou shouldst
say, Thou hast made a division among the children of
Israel, and hast not waited for my sentence. <i>Moses</i> said,
And what was thy motive <i>for doing as thou hast</i>, O
S&aacute;miree? He answered, I saw that which they saw not;<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a>
therefore I took a handful <i>of dust</i> from the foot-marks <i>of
the horse</i> of the apostle <i>Gabriel</i>, and cast it <i>into the molten
calf</i>; and thus my soul allured me <i>to take a handful of the
dust above-mentioned, and to cast it upon that which had no
life, that it might have life; and I saw that thy people had
demanded of thee that thou wouldst make them a god; so
my soul suggested to me that this calf should be their god.</i>
<i>Moses</i> said <i>unto him</i>, Then get thee gone <i>from among us</i>,
and [the punishment] for thee during <i>the period of thy</i>
life [shall be], that thou shalt say <i>unto whomsoever thou
shalt see</i>, Touch <i>me</i> not:&mdash;(<i>so he used to wander about the
desert, and when he touched any one, or any one touched him,
they both became affected with a burning fever:</i>) and verily
for thee is a threat which thou shalt by no means find to
be false. And look at thy god, to <i>the worship of</i> which
thou hast continued devoted. We will assuredly burn it:
then we will assuredly reduce it to powder and scatter it
in the sea. (<i>And Moses, after he had slaughtered it, did
this.</i>) Your deity is God only, except whom there is no
deity. He comprehendeth all things by <i>His</i> knowledge.&mdash;Thus,
<i>O Mo&#7717;ammad</i>, do We relate unto thee accounts of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span>
what hath happened heretofore; and We have given thee,
from Us, an admonition; <i>namely the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n</i>.</p>

<p class="name">(xx. 88-99.)</p>

<p>And they were made to drink down the calf into their
hearts,<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> (<i>that is, the love of it mingled with their hearts as
drink mingleth</i>,) because of their unbelief.</p>

<p class="name">(ii. 87.)</p>

<p>[Remember, O children of Israel,] when Moses said unto
his people <i>who worshipped the calf</i>, O my people, verily ye
have injured your own souls by your taking to yourselves
the calf <i>as a god</i>; therefore turn with repentance unto
your Creator <i>from the worship of it</i>, and slay one another:
(<i>that is, let the innocent among you slay the criminal</i>:) this
will be best for you in the estimation of your Creator.
<i>And He aided you to do that, sending upon you a black
cloud, lest one of you should see another and have compassion
on him, until there were slain of you about seventy thousand.</i>
And <i>thereupon</i> He became propitious towards you, <i>accepting
your repentance</i>; for He is the Very Propitious, the
Merciful.</p>

<p class="name">(ii. 51.)</p>

<p>[Remember also, O children of Israel,] when ye said,
<i>having gone forth with Moses to beg pardon of God for your
worship of the calf, and having heard his words</i>, O Moses,
we will not believe thee until we see God manifestly:&mdash;whereupon
the vehement sound assailed you, <i>and ye died</i>,
while ye beheld <i>what happened to you</i>. Then We raised
you to life after ye had been dead, that peradventure ye
might give thanks.<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a></p>

<p class="name">(ii. 52, 53.)</p>

<p>And Moses chose <i>from</i> his people seventy men, <i>of those
who had not worshipped the calf, by the command of God</i>, at
the time appointed by Us <i>for their coming to ask pardon</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span>
<i>for their companions&#8217; worship of the calf; and he went forth
with them</i>; and when the convulsion (<i>the violent earthquake</i>)
took them away (<i>because, saith Ibn-&acute;Abb&aacute;s, they
did not separate themselves from their people when the
latter worshipped the calf</i>), <i>Moses</i> said, O my Lord, if Thou
hadst pleased, Thou hadst destroyed them before <i>my going
forth with them, that the children of Israel might have
beheld it and might not suspect me</i>; and me [also]. Wilt
Thou destroy us for that which the foolish among us have
done? It is naught but Thy trial: Thou wilt cause to
err thereby whom Thou pleasest, and Thou wilt rightly
guide whom Thou pleasest. Thou art our guardian; and
do Thou forgive us and have mercy upon us; for Thou
art the best of those who forgive: and appoint for us in
this world what is good, and in the world to come; for
unto Thee have we turned with repentance.&mdash;<i>God</i> replied,
I will afflict with My punishment whom I please, and My
mercy extendeth over everything <i>in the world</i>; and I will
appoint it, <i>in the world to come</i>, for those who fear and
give the legal alms, and those who believe on Our signs,
who shall follow the apostle, the illiterate [or Gentile, <i>i.e.</i>, Arab] prophet,
<i>Mo&#7717;ammad</i>, whom they shall find written down with
them in the Pentateuch and the Gospel, <i>by his name and
his description</i>. He will command them that which is
right, and forbid them that which is evil; and will allow
them as lawful the good things <i>among those forbidden in
their law</i>, and prohibit them the impure, <i>as carrion and
other things</i>, and will take off from them their burden and
the yokes that were upon them, <i>as the slaying of a soul</i>
[for an atonement] <i>in repentance, and the cutting off of the
mark left by impurity</i>. And those who shall believe in
him and honour him and assist him and follow the light
which shall be sent down with him, <i>namely the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n</i>,
these shall be the prosperous.</p>

<p class="name">(vii. 154-156).</p>

<p>And <i>remember</i> when Moses said unto his people, O my
people, remember the favour of God towards you, since
He hath appointed prophets from among you, and made
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg&nbsp;123]</a></span>
you princes (<i>masters of servants and other attendants</i>), and
given you what He hath not given any [other] of the
peoples (<i>as the manna and the quails and other things</i>).
O my people, enter the Holy Land which God hath
decreed for you (<i>namely Syria</i>), and turn not back, lest
ye turn losers.&mdash;They replied, O Moses, verily there is in
it a gigantic people, <i>of the remains of the tribe of &acute;&Aacute;d</i>, and
we will not enter it until they go forth from it; but if
they go forth from it, then we will enter.&mdash;[Thereupon]
two men, of those who feared <i>to disobey God, namely
Joshua and Caleb, of the chiefs whom Moses sent to discover
the circumstances of the giants, and</i> upon whom God had
conferred favour, <i>and who had concealed what they had seen
of the state of the giants, excepting from Moses, wherefore the
other chiefs became cowardly</i>, said <i>unto them</i>, Enter ye upon
them through the gate <i>of the city, and fear them not; for
they are bodies without hearts</i>; and when ye enter it, ye
overcome; and upon God place your dependence, if ye be
believers.&mdash;[But] they said, O Moses, we will never enter
it while they remain therein. Therefore go thou and thy
Lord, and fight: for we remain here.&mdash;<i>Then Moses</i> said, O
my Lord, verily I am not master of any but myself and
my brother: therefore distinguish between us and the
unrighteous people.&mdash;<i>God</i> replied, Verily it (<i>namely the
Holy Land</i>) shall be forbidden them forty years; they
shall wander in perplexity in the land: and be not thou
solicitous for the unrighteous people.&mdash;<i>The land</i> [through
which they wandered] <i>was</i> [only] <i>nine leagues</i> [in extent].
<i>They used to journey during the night with diligence; but
in the morning they found themselves in the place whence
they had set forth; and they journeyed during the day in
like manner. Thus they did until all of them had become
extinct, excepting those who had not attained the age of
twenty years; and it is said that they were six hundred
thousand. Aaron and Moses died in the desert; and mercy
was their lot: but punishment was the lot of those. And
Moses begged his Lord, when he was about to die, that He</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg&nbsp;124]</a></span>
<i>would bring him as near as a stone&#8217;s throw to the Holy
Land: wherefore He did so. And Joshua was made a
prophet after the forty [years], and he gave orders to fight
against the giants. So he went with those who were with
him, and fought against them: and it was Friday; and
the sun stood still for him awhile, until he had made an
end of fighting against them.</i></p>

<p class="name">(v. 23-29).</p>

<p>&#7730;&aacute;roon<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> [or Korah] was of the people of Moses (<i>he was
the son of his paternal uncle, and the son of his maternal
aunt, and he believed in him</i>); but he behaved insolently
towards them; for We had bestowed upon him such
treasures that their keys were heavy burdens for a company
of men endowed with strength, <i>in number, as some
say, seventy; and some, forty; and some, ten; and some,
another number. Remember when his people (the believers
among the children of Israel)</i> said unto him, Rejoice not
<i>exultingly in the abundance of thy wealth</i>; for God loveth
not those who <i>so</i> rejoice; but seek to attain, by means of
the <i>wealth</i> which God hath given thee, the latter abode
[of Paradise], <i>by expending thy wealth in the service of
God</i>; and neglect not thy part in this world, <i>to work
therein for the world to come</i>; but be beneficent <i>unto
mankind, by bestowing alms</i>, as God hath been beneficent
unto thee; and seek not to act corruptly in the earth; for
God loveth not the corrupt doers. He replied, I have only
been given it on account of the knowledge that I possess.
<i>For he was the most learned of the children of Israel in the
Law, after Moses and Aaron. God saith</i>, Did he not know
that God had destroyed before him, of the generations,
those that were mightier than he in strength and who
had amassed more abundance <i>of wealth</i>? And the wicked
shall not be asked respecting their sins, <i>because God
knoweth them: therefore they shall be sent into the Fire without
a reckoning</i>. And <i>&#7730;&aacute;roon</i> went forth unto his people
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span>
in his pomp, <i>with his many dependants mounted, adorned
with garments of gold and silk, upon decked horses and mules</i>.
Those who desired the present life said, O would that
we had the like of that which hath been bestowed on
&#7730;&aacute;roon <i>in this world</i>! Verily he is possessed of great
good fortune!&mdash;But those unto whom knowledge <i>of what
God hath promised in the world to come</i> had been given,
said <i>unto them</i>, Woe to you! The reward of God <i>in the
world to come</i> (<i>which is Paradise</i>) is better for him who
believeth and worketh righteousness <i>than that which hath
been bestowed on &#7730;&aacute;roon in the present world</i>; and none
shall receive it but the patient <i>in the service of God</i>. And
We caused the earth to cleave asunder and swallow up
him and his mansion,<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> and he had no forces to defend
him, in the place of God, nor was he of the [number of
the] saved. And the next morning, those who had wished
for his place the day before said, Aha! God enlargeth
provision unto whom He pleaseth of His servants, and is
sparing <i>of it unto whom He pleaseth!</i> Had not God been
gracious unto us, He had caused [the earth] to cleave
asunder and swallow up us! Aha! the ungrateful <i>for
His benefits</i> do not prosper!</p>

<p class="name">(xxviii. 76-82.)</p>

<p><i>Remember</i>, [O children of Israel,] when Moses said unto
his people (<i>when one of them had been slain, whose murderer
was not known, and they asked him to beg God that He would
discover him to them, wherefore he supplicated Him</i>), Verily
God commandeth you to sacrifice a cow. They said, Dost
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg&nbsp;126]</a></span>
thou make a jest of us? He said, I beg God to preserve
me from being <i>one</i> of the foolish. <i>So when they knew that
he decidedly intended</i> [what he had ordered], they said,
Supplicate for us thy Lord, that He may manifest to us
what she is; <i>that is, what is her age</i>. <i>Moses</i> replied, He
saith, She is a cow neither old nor young; <i>but</i> of a middle
age, between those <i>two</i>: therefore do as ye are commanded.
They said, Supplicate for us thy Lord, that He may manifest
to us what is her colour. He replied, He saith, She
is a red<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> cow: her colour is very bright: she rejoiceth the
beholders. They said, Supplicate for us thy Lord, that He
may manifest to us what she is, <i>whether she be a pasturing
or a working cow</i>; for cows <i>of the description mentioned</i>
are to us like one another; and we, if God please, shall
indeed be rightly directed <i>to her</i>. (<i>In a tradition it is said,
Had they not said, &#8216;If God please,&#8217;&mdash;she had not ever been
manifested to them.</i>) He replied, He saith, She is a cow
not subdued <i>by work</i> that plougheth the ground, nor doth
she water the field: [she is] free <i>from defects and the
marks of work</i>; there is no colour in her different from the
rest of her colour. They said, Now thou hast brought the
truth. <i>And they sought her, and found her in the possession
of the young man who acted piously towards his mother, and
they bought her for as much gold as her hide would contain.</i><a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg&nbsp;127]</a></span>
Then they sacrificed her; but they were near to leaving it
undone, on <i>account of the greatness of her price</i>. (<i>And in a
tradition it is said, Had they sacrificed any cow whatever,
He had satisfied them: but they acted hardly towards themselves;
so God acted hardly towards them.</i>) And when ye
slew a soul, and contended together respecting it, (and God
brought forth [to light] that which ye did conceal&mdash;<i>this is
the beginning of the story</i> [and was the occasion of the
order to sacrifice this particular cow,]) We said, Strike him
(<i>that is, the slain person</i>) with part of her. <i>So he was struck
with her tongue, or the root of her tail, or, as some say, with
her right thigh; whereupon he came to life, and said, Such-a-one
and such-a-one slew me,&mdash;to the two sons of his uncle.
And he died. They two</i> [the murderers] <i>were therefore deprived
of the inheritance, and were slain.</i><a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> Thus God
raiseth to life the dead, and showeth you His signs (<i>the
proof of His power</i>), that peradventure ye may understand,
<i>and know that He who is able to raise to life one soul is able
to raise to life many souls.</i> Then your hearts became hard,
<i>O ye Jews, so as not to accept the truth</i>, after that, and they
[were] as stones, or more hard: for of stones there are
indeed some from which rivers gush forth; and of them
there are indeed some that cleave asunder and water
issueth from them; and of them there are indeed some
that fall down through fear of God; <i>whereas your hearts
are not impressed, nor do they grow soft, nor do they become
humble.</i> But God is not heedless of that which ye do: <i>He
only reserveth you unto your time.</i></p>

<p class="name">(ii. 63-69.)</p>

<p><i>Remember</i> when Moses said to his young man <i>Joshua the
son of Nun, who served him and acquired knowledge from
him</i>, I will not cease <i>to go forward</i> until I reach the place
where the two seas (<i>the Sea of Greece and the Sea of Persia</i>)
meet, or travel for a long space of time. And when they
reached the place where they (<i>the two seas</i>) met they forgot
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg&nbsp;128]</a></span>
their fish: <i>Joshua forgot to take it up, on their departure;
and Moses forgot to remind him</i>; and it made its
way in the sea by a hollow passage, <i>God withholding the
water from it</i>. And when they had passed beyond <i>that
place, and proceeded until the time of the morning-meal on
the following day</i>, [Moses] said unto his young man, Bring
us our morning-meal: we have experienced fatigue from
this our journey. He replied, What thinkest thou?
When we repaired to the rock to rest <i>at that place</i>, I forgot
the fish, and none made me forget to mention it but the
devil; and it made its way in the sea in a wonderful
manner.&mdash;<i>Moses</i> said, That (<i>namely our loss of the fish</i>) is
what we were desiring; <i>for it is a sign unto us of our finding
him whom we seek</i>. And they returned by the way
that they had come, following the footsteps, <i>and came to
the rock</i>. And they found one of Our servants (<i>namely El-Khi&#7693;r</i><a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a>)
unto whom We had granted mercy from Us (<i>that is
the gift of prophecy in the opinion of some, and the rank of
a saint according to another opinion which most of the
learned hold</i>), and whom We had taught knowledge from Us
respecting things unseen.&mdash;<i>El-Bukh&aacute;ree hath related a tradition
stating that Moses performed the office of a preacher
among the children of Israel, and was asked who was the
most knowing of men; to which he answered, I:&mdash;whereupon
God blamed him for this, because he did not refer the</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg&nbsp;129]</a></span>
<i>knowledge thereof to Him. And God said unto him by revelation,
Verily I have a servant at the place where the two seas
meet, and he is more knowing than thou. Moses said, O my
Lord, and how shall I meet with him? He answered, Thou
shalt take with thee a fish, and put it into a measuring-vessel,
and where thou shalt lose the fish, there is he. So he
took a fish, and put it into a vessel. Then he departed, and
Joshua the son of Nun departed with him, until they came
to the rock, where they laid down their heads and slept.
And the fish became agitated in the vessel, and escaped from
it, and fell into the sea, and it made its way in the sea by a
hollow passage, God withholding the water from the fish so
that it became like a vault over it: and when Moses&#8217; companion
awoke, he forgot to inform him of the fish.</i></p>

<p>Moses said unto him [namely El-Khi&#7693;r], Shall I follow
thee, that thou mayest teach me [part] of that which thou
hast been taught, for a direction <i>unto me</i>? He answered,
Verily thou canst not have patience with me. For how
canst thou be patient with respect to that whereof thou
comprehendest not the knowledge?&mdash;He replied, Thou
shalt find me, if God please, patient; and I will not
disobey any command of thine. He said, Then if thou
follow me, ask me not respecting anything: <i>but be patient</i>
until I give thee an account thereof. <i>And Moses assented
to his condition.</i> And they departed, <i>walking along the
shore of the sea</i>, until, when they embarked in the ship
<i>that passed by them</i>, he (El-Khi&#7693;r) made a hole in it, <i>by
pulling out a plank or two planks from it on the outside by
means of an axe when it reached the middle of the sea.
Moses</i> said <i>unto him</i>, Hast thou made a hole in it that
thou mayest drown its people? Thou hast done a
grievous thing.&mdash;(<i>But it is related that the water entered
not the hole.</i>) He replied, Did I not say that thou couldst
not have patience with me? [Moses] said, Chastise me
not for my forgetfulness, nor impose on me a difficulty in
my case.&mdash;And they departed, <i>after they had gone forth
from the vessel</i>, <i>walking on</i>, until, when they found a boy <i>who</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg&nbsp;130]</a></span>
<i>had not attained the age of knowing right and wrong, playing
with other children, and he was the most beautiful of them
in countenance</i>, and he (<i>El-Khi&#7693;r</i>) slew him, <i>Moses</i> said
<i>unto him</i>, Hast thou slain an innocent soul, without <i>his
having slain</i> a soul? Thou hast done an iniquitous thing.&mdash;He
replied, Did I not say that thou couldst not have
patience with me? [Moses] said, If I ask thee concerning
anything after this <i>time</i>, suffer me not to accompany thee.
Now hast thou received from me an excuse <i>for thy
separating thyself from me</i>.&mdash;And they departed [and
proceeded] until, when they came to the people of a city
(<i>which was Antioch<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a></i>), they asked food of its people; but
they refused to entertain them: and they found therein
a wall, <i>the height whereof was a hundred cubits</i>, which
was about to fall down; whereupon he (<i>El-Khi&#7693;r</i>) set it
upright <i>with his hand</i>. <i>Moses</i> said <i>unto him</i>, If thou
wouldst, thou mightest have obtained pay for it, <i>since they
did not entertain us, notwithstanding our want of food</i>.
<i>El-Khi&#7693;r</i> said <i>unto him</i>, This shall be a separation
between me and thee; <i>but before my separation from thee</i>,
I will declare unto thee the interpretation of that which
thou couldst not bear with patience.</p>

<p>As to the vessel, it belonged to <i>ten</i> poor men,<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> who
pursued their business on the sea; and I desired to render
it unsound; for there was behind them a king, <i>an
unbeliever</i>, who took every <i>sound</i> vessel by force. And as
to the boy, his parents were believers, and we feared that
he would transgress against them rebelliously and impiously:
<i>for, according to a tradition related by Muslim, he
was constituted by nature an unbeliever, and had he lived
he had so acted</i>; wherefore we desired that their Lord should
create for them a better than he in virtue, and [one] more
disposed than he to filial piety. <i>And God created for
them a daughter, who married a prophet, and gave birth to</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg&nbsp;131]</a></span>
<i>a prophet, by means of whom God directed a people to the
right way</i>. And as to the wall, it belonged to two orphan
youths in the city, and beneath it was a treasure <i>buried</i>,
<i>of gold and silver</i>, belonging to them; and their father
was a righteous man; and thy Lord desired that they
should attain their age of strength and take forth their
treasure through the mercy of thy Lord. And I did it
not (<i>namely what hath been mentioned</i>) of mine own will,
<i>but by direction of God</i>. This is the interpretation of that
which thou couldst not bear with patience. (Chap. xviii. 59-81.)</p>

<h3><i>SAUL, DAVID, SOLOMON.</i></h3>

<p>Hast thou not considered the assembly of the children
of Israel after <i>the death of</i> Moses, when they said unto a
prophet of theirs, <i>namely Samuel</i>, Set up for us a king,
<i>under whom</i> we will fight in the way of God? He said
<i>unto them</i>, If fighting be prescribed as incumbent on you,
will ye, peradventure, abstain from fighting? They replied,
And wherefore should we not fight in the way of
God, since we have been expelled from our habitations
and our children <i>by their having been taken prisoners and
slain?</i>&mdash;<i>The people of Goliath</i> [J&aacute;loot] <i>had done thus unto
them</i>.&mdash;But when fighting was commanded them, they
turned back, excepting a few of them, <i>who crossed the river
with Saul</i> [&#7788;&aacute;loot], <i>as will be related</i>. And God knoweth
the offenders. <i>And the prophet begged his Lord to send a
king; whereupon he consented to send Saul.</i> And their
prophet said unto them, Verily God hath set up Saul as
your king. They said, How shall he have the dominion
over us, when we are more worthy of the dominion than
he, (<i>for he was not of the royal lineage, nor of the prophetic,
and he was a tanner, or a tender of flocks or herds,</i>) and he
hath not been endowed with ample wealth? He replied,
Verily God hath chosen him <i>as king</i> over you, and increased
him in largeness of knowledge and of body, (<i>for
he was the wisest of the children of Israel at that time, and
the most comely of them, and the most perfect of them in
make,</i>) and God giveth his kingdom unto whom He
pleaseth; and God is ample <i>in His beneficence</i>, knowing
<i>with respect to him who is worthy of the kingdom</i>.&mdash;And their
prophet said unto them, <i>when they demanded of him a sign</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg&nbsp;133]</a></span>
<i>in proof of his kingship</i>, Verily the sign of his kingship
shall be that the ark shall come unto you (<i>in it were the
images of the prophets: God sent it down unto Adam, and it
passed into their possession; but the Amalekites took it from
them by force: and they used to seek victory thereby over
their enemy, and to advance it in the fight, and to trust in it,
as He&mdash;whose name be exalted!&mdash;hath said</i>); therein [shall
be] tranquillity from your Lord,<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> and relics of what the
family of Moses and the family of Aaron have left:
<i>namely, the two shoes (or sandals) of Moses, and his rod, and
the turban of Aaron, and a measure of the manna that used
to descend upon them, and the fragments of the tables</i> [of the
Law]: the angels shall bear it. Verily in this shall be a
sign unto you <i>of his kingship</i>, if ye be believers. <i>Accordingly
the angels bore it between heaven and earth, while they
looked at it, until they placed it by Saul; whereupon they
acknowledged his kingship, and hastened to the holy war;
and he chose of their young men seventy thousand.</i></p>

<p>And when Saul went forth with the troops <i>from Jerusalem,
and it was violently hot weather, and they demanded
of him water</i>, he said, Verily God will try you by a river,
<i>that the obedient among you, and the disobedient, may appear</i>,
(<i>and it was between the Jordan and Palestine</i>,) and whoso
drinketh thereof, he is not of my party (but he who
tasteth not thereof, he is of my party), excepting him who
taketh forth a draught in his hand, <i>and is satisfied therewith,
not adding to it; for he is of my party</i>;&mdash;then they
drank thereof abundantly, excepting a few of them, <i>who
were content only with the handful of water. It is related
that it sufficed them for their own drinking and for their
beasts, and they were three hundred, and somewhat more</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg&nbsp;134]</a></span>
<i>than ten.</i> And when he had passed over it, he and those
who believed with him, they (<i>that is, those who had drunk</i>
[plentifully]) said, We have no power to-day <i>to contend</i>
against Goliath and his troops. <i>And they were cowardly,
and passed not over it.</i> They [however] who held it as
certain that they should meet God <i>at the resurrection</i> (<i>and
they were those who had passed over it</i>) said, How many a
small body of men hath overcome a great body by the
permission (<i>or will</i>) of God! And God is with the patient,
<i>to defend and aid</i>.&mdash;And when they went forth to battle
against Goliath and his troops, they said, O our Lord, pour
upon us patience, and make firm our feet, <i>by strengthening
our hearts for the holy war</i>, and help us against the unbelieving
people!&mdash;And they routed them by the permission
(<i>or will</i>) of God, and David [D&aacute;wood, vulg. D&aacute;ood],
<i>who was in the army of Saul</i>, slew Goliath. And God
gave him (<i>David</i>) the kingship <i>over the children of Israel</i>,
and wisdom (<i>that is prophecy</i>), <i>after the death of Samuel
and Saul, and they</i> [namely these two gifts] <i>had not
been given together to any one before him</i>; and He taught
him what He pleased,<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> <i>as the art of making coats of mail,
and the language of birds</i>. And were it not for God&#8217;s
repelling men, one by another, surely the earth had become
corrupt <i>by the predominance of the polytheists and the
slaughter of the Muslims and the ruin of the places of
worship</i>: but God is beneficent to the peoples, <i>and hath
repelled some by others</i>.</p>

<p>Hath the story of the two opposing parties come unto
thee, <i>O Mo&#7717;ammad</i>, when they ascended over the walls
of the oratory of <i>David, having been prevented going in
unto him by the door, because of his being engaged in devotion?</i>
When they went in unto David, and he was
frightened at them, they said, Fear not: <i>we are</i> two
opposing parties. <i>It is said that they were two parties of
more than one each; and it is said that they were two
individuals, angels, who came as two litigants, to admonish
David, who had ninety-nine wives, and had desired the wife
of a person who had none but her, and married her and
taken her as his wife.</i><a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> [One of them said,] One of us
hath wronged the other; therefore judge between us with
truth, and be not unjust, but direct us into the right way.
Verily this my brother <i>in religion</i> had nine-and-ninety
ewes, and I had one ewe; and he said, Make me her
keeper. And he overcame me in the dispute.&mdash;<i>And the
other confessed him to have spoken truth.</i>&mdash;[David] said,
Verily he hath wronged thee in demanding thy ewe <i>to
add her</i> to his ewes; and verily many associates wrong
one another, except those who believe and do righteous
deeds: and few indeed are they.&mdash;<i>And the two angels said,
ascending in their</i> [proper or assumed] <i>forms to heaven,
The man hath passed sentence against himself. So David
was admonished.</i> And David perceived that We had tried
him <i>by his love of that woman</i>; wherefore he asked pardon
of his Lord, and fell down bowing himself (<i>or prostrating
himself</i>), and repented. So We forgave him that; and
verily for him [was ordained] a high rank with Us (<i>that is,
an increase of good fortune in this world</i>), and [there shall
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg&nbsp;136]</a></span>
be for him] an excellent retreat <i>in the world to come</i>.</p>

<p class="name">(xxxviii. 20-24.)</p>

<p>We compelled the mountains to glorify Us, with David,
and the birds <i>also, on his commanding them to do so, when
he experienced languor</i>; and We did <i>this</i>. And We taught
him the art of making coats of mail (<i>for before his time
plates of metal were used</i>) for you <i>among mankind in
general</i>, that they might defend you from your suffering
<i>in warring with your enemies</i>.&mdash;Will ye then, <i>O people of
Mekkeh</i>, be thankful <i>for My favours, believing the apostles</i>?&mdash;And
<i>We subjected</i> unto Solomon [Suleym&aacute;n] the wind,
blowing strongly, <i>and being light at his desire</i>, which ran
at his command<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> to the land that We blessed (<i>namely
Syria</i>);<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> and We knew all things (<i>knowing that what We
gave him would stimulate him to be submissive to his Lord</i>).
And <i>We subjected</i>, of the devils, those who should dive for
him <i>in the sea and bring forth from it jewels for him</i>, and
do other work besides that; <i>that is, building, and performing
other services</i>; and We watched over them, <i>that they
might not spoil what they executed; for they used, when they
had finished a work before night, to spoil it, if they were
not employed in something else</i>.</p>

<p class="name">(xxi. 79-82.)</p>

<p>We gave unto David Solomon <i>his son</i>. How excellent
a servant <i>was he</i>! For he was one who earnestly turned
himself unto God, <i>glorifying and praising Him at all
times</i>. [Remember] when, in the latter part of the day,
<i>after the commencement of the declining of the sun</i>, the
<i>mares</i> standing on three feet and touching the ground
with the edge of the fourth foot, swift in the course, were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg&nbsp;137]</a></span>
displayed before him. <i>They were a thousand mares, which
were displayed before him after he had performed the noon-prayers,
on the occasion of his desiring to make use of them
in a holy war; and when nine hundred of them had been
displayed, the sun set, and he had not performed the afternoon-prayers.
So he was grieved</i>, and he said, Verily I
have preferred the love of [earthly] goods above the
remembrance of my Lord, (<i>that is, the performance of the
afternoon-prayers</i>,) so that <i>the sun</i> is concealed by the
veil. Bring them (<i>namely the horses</i>) back unto me.
<i>Therefore they brought them back.</i> And he began to sever
<i>with his sword</i> the legs and the necks, <i>slaughtering them,
and</i> [then] <i>cutting off their legs, as a sacrifice unto God, and
gave their flesh in alms; and God gave him in compensation
what was better than they were and swifter, namely the
wind, which travelled by his command whithersoever he desired.</i>&mdash;And
We tried Solomon <i>by depriving him of his kingdom.
This was because he married a woman of whom he became
enamoured, and she used to worship an idol in his palace
without his knowledge. His dominion was in his signet;
and he pulled it off once and deposited it with his wife, who
was named El-Emeeneh; and a jinnee came unto her in the
form of Solomon, and took it from her.</i> And We placed
upon his throne a [counterfeit] body; <i>namely that jinnee,
who was &#7778;akhr, or another. He sat upon the throne of
Solomon, and the birds and other creatures surrounded him;
and Solomon went forth, with a changed appearance, and
saw him upon his throne, and said unto the people, I am
Solomon:&mdash;but they denied him.</i> Then he returned <i>unto
his kingdom, after some days, having obtained the signet and
put it on, and seated himself upon his throne.</i><a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> He said, O
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg&nbsp;138]</a></span>
my Lord, forgive me, and give me a dominion that may
not be to any one after me (<i>or beside me</i>); for Thou art
the Liberal Giver. So We subjected unto him the wind,
which ran gently at his command whithersoever he
desired; and the devils [also], every builder <i>of wonderful
structures</i>, and diver <i>that brought up pearls from the sea</i>, and
others bound in chains <i>which connected their hands to their
necks. And We said unto him</i>, This is Our gift, and bestow
thou <i>thereof upon whomsoever thou wilt</i>, or refrain <i>from
bestowing</i>, without <i>rendering</i> an account. And verily for
him [was ordained] a high rank with Us, and an excellent
retreat.</p>

<p class="name">(xxxviii. 29-39.)</p>

<p>We bestowed on David and Solomon knowledge <i>in
judging men and in the language of the birds and other
matters</i>; and they said, Praise be to God who hath made
us to excel many of His believing servants, <i>by the gift of
prophecy and by the subjection of the jinn and mankind
and the devils</i>. And Solomon inherited from David <i>the
gift of prophecy and knowledge</i>; and he said, O men, we
have been taught the language of the birds,<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> and have had
bestowed on us of everything <i>wherewith prophets and kings
are gifted</i>. Verily this is manifest excellence.&mdash;And his
armies of jinn and men and birds were gathered together
unto Solomon, and they were led on in order, until, when
they came unto the valley of ants, (<i>which</i> [was] <i>at E&#7789;-&#7788;&aacute;&iuml;f
or in Syria, the ants whereof</i> [were] <i>small or great</i>,) an ant
(<i>the queen of the ants</i>), <i>having seen the troops of Solomon</i>,
said, O ants, enter your habitations, lest Solomon and his
troops crush you violently, while they perceive not. And
<i>Solomon</i> smiled, <i>afterwards</i> laughing at her saying, <i>which
he heard from the distance of three miles, the wind conveying
it to him: so he withheld his forces when he came in sight
of their valley, until the ants had entered their dwellings:
and his troops were on horses and on foot in this expedition</i>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg&nbsp;139]</a></span>
And he said, O my Lord, inspire me to be thankful for
Thy favour which Thou hast bestowed upon me and upon
my parents, and to do righteousness which Thou shalt
approve, and admit me, in Thy mercy, among Thy servants,
the righteous, <i>the prophets and the saints</i>.</p>

<p>And he examined the birds,<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> <i>that he might see the lapwing,
that saw the water beneath the earth, and directed to it
by pecking the earth, whereupon the devils used to draw it
forth when Solomon wanted it</i> [to perform the ablution]
<i>for prayer; but he saw it not</i>: and he said, Wherefore do
I not see the lapwing? Is it [one] of the absent?&mdash;<i>And
when he was certain of the case he said</i>, I will assuredly
punish it with a severe punishment, <i>by plucking out its
feathers and its tail and casting it in the sun so that it
shall not be able to guard against excessive thirst</i>; or I will
slaughter it; or it shall bring me a manifest convincing
proof <i>showing its excuse</i>.&mdash;And it tarried not long <i>before it
presented itself unto Solomon submissively, and raised its
head and relaxed its tail and its wings: so he forgave it;
and he asked it what it had met with during its absence</i>;
and it said, I have become acquainted with that wherewith
thou hast not become acquainted, and I have
come unto thee from Seba (<i>a tribe of El-Yemen</i>) with a
sure piece of news. I found a woman reigning over them,
<i>named Bil&#7731;ees</i>, and she hath been gifted with everything
<i>that princes require</i>, and hath a magnificent throne. <i>(Its
length was eighty cubits; and its breadth, forty cubits; and
its height, thirty cubits: it was composed of gold and silver
set with fine pearls and with rubies and chrysolites, and its legs
were of rubies and chrysolites and emeralds: upon it</i> [were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg&nbsp;140]</a></span>
closed] <i>seven doors: to each chamber</i> [through which one
passed to it was] <i>a closed door</i>.) I found her and her people
worshipping the sun instead of God, and the devil hath
made their works to seem comely unto them, so that he
hath hindered them from the <i>right</i> way, wherefore they
are not rightly directed to the worship of God, who
produceth what is hidden (<i>namely the rain and vegetables</i>)
in the heavens and the earth, and knoweth what they
[that is, mankind and others] conceal <i>in their hearts</i>, and
what they reveal <i>with their tongues</i>. God: there is no
deity but He, the Lord of the magnificent throne, <i>between
which and the throne of Bil&#7731;ees is a vast difference</i>.</p>

<p><i>Solomon</i> said <i>to the lapwing</i>, We will see whether thou
hast spoken truth or whether thou art of the liars.
<i>Then the lapwing guided them to the water, and it was
drawn forth</i> [by the devils]; <i>and they quenched their thirst
and performed the ablution and prayed. Then Solomon
wrote a letter, the form whereof was this:&mdash;From the servant
of God, Solomon the son of David, to Bil&#7731;ees the queen of
Seba. In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.
Peace be on whomsoever followeth the right direction.
After</i> [this salutation, I say], <i>Act ye not proudly towards
me; but come unto me submitting.&mdash;He then sealed it with
musk, and stamped it with his signet, and said unto the
lapwing</i>, Go with this my letter and throw it down unto
them (<i>namely Bil&#7731;ees and her people</i>): then turn away
from them, <i>but stay near them</i>, and see what <i>reply</i> they
will return. <i>So the lapwing took it, and came unto her,
and around her were her forces; and he threw it down into
her lap; and when she saw it, she trembled with fear.
Then she considered what was in it, and</i> she said <i>unto the
nobles of her people</i>, O nobles, an honourable (<i>sealed</i>) letter
hath been thrown down unto me. It is from Solomon;
and it is <i>this</i>:&mdash;In the name of God, the Compassionate,
the Merciful. Act ye not proudly towards me: but come
unto me submitting.&mdash;She said, O nobles, advise me in
mine affair. I will not decide upon a thing unless ye
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg&nbsp;141]</a></span>
bear me witness.&mdash;They replied, We are endowed with
strength and endowed with great valour; but the
command [belongeth] to thee; therefore see what thou
wilt command <i>us to do, and we will obey thee</i>. She said,
Verily kings, when they enter a city, waste it, and render
the mighty of its inhabitants abject; and thus will they
do <i>who have sent the letter</i>. But I will send unto them with
a gift, and I will see with what the messengers will return,
<i>whether the gift will be accepted, or whether it will be rejected.
If he be</i> [merely] <i>a king, he will accept it; and if he be a
prophet, he will not accept it.&mdash;And she sent male and
female servants, a thousand in equal numbers</i> [five hundred
of each sex], <i>and five hundred bricks of gold, and a crown
set with jewels, and musk and ambergris and other things,
by a messenger with a letter.<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> And the lapwing hastened
unto Solomon, to tell him the news; on hearing which, he
commanded that bricks of gold and silver should be cast,
and that a horse-course should be extended to the length of
nine leagues from the place where he was, and that they
should build around it a wall with battlements, of gold and
silver, and that the handsomest of the beasts of the land
and of the sea should be brought with the sons of the jinn
on the right side of the horse-course and on its left.</i></p>

<p>And when <i>the messenger</i> came <i>with the gift, and with
him his attendants</i>, unto Solomon, he [Solomon] said, Do
ye aid me with wealth? But what God hath given
me (<i>namely the gift of prophecy and the kingdom</i>) is better
than what He hath given you, <i>of worldly goods</i>; yet ye
rejoice in your gift, <i>because ye glory in the showy things
of this world</i>. Return unto them <i>with the gift that thou
hast brought</i>; for we will surely come unto them with
forces with which they have not power [to contend], and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg&nbsp;142]</a></span>
we will surely drive them out from it, (<i>that is, from their
country, Seba, which was named after the father of their
tribe</i>,) abject and contemptible, <i>if they come not unto us
submitting. And when the messenger returned unto her
with the gift, she placed her throne within seven doors,
within her palace, and her palace was within seven palaces;
and she closed the doors, and set guards to them, and prepared
to go unto Solomon, that she might see what he would
command her to do. She departed with twelve thousand
kings, each king having with him many thousands, and
proceeded until she came as near to him as a league&#8217;s
distance; when he knew of her</i> [approach,] he said, O
nobles, which of you will bring unto me her throne before
they come unto me submitting? An &acute;efreet, of the jinn,
answered, I will bring it unto thee before thou shalt arise
from thy place <i>wherein thou sittest to judge from morning
until mid-day</i>; for I am able to do it, [and] trustworthy
<i>with respect to the jewels that it compriseth and other
matters. Solomon said, I desire it more speedily.</i> [And
thereupon] he with whom was knowledge of the <i>revealed</i>
scripture (<i>namely</i> [his Wezeer] <i>&Aacute;&#7779;af the son of Barkhiya,
who was a just person, acquainted with the most great name
of God, which ensured an answer to him who invoked thereby</i><a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a>)
said, I will bring it unto thee before thy glance can
be withdrawn <i>from any object. And he said unto him,
Look at the sky. So he looked at it; then he withdrew his
glance, and found it placed before him: for during his look
towards the sky, &Aacute;&#7779;af prayed, by the most great name, that
God would bring it; and it so happened, the throne passing
under the ground until it came up before the throne of
Solomon.</i> And when he saw it firmly placed before him,
he said, This is of the favour of my Lord, that He may try
me, whether I shall be thankful or whether I shall be
unthankful. And he who is thankful is thankful for <i>the
sake of</i> his own soul, <i>which will have the reward of his</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg&nbsp;143]</a></span>
<i>thankfulness</i>; and [as to] him who is ungrateful, my Lord
is independent [and] bountiful.</p>

<p>[Then Solomon] said, Alter ye her throne so that it may
not be known by her, that we may see whether she be
rightly directed <i>to the knowledge thereof</i>, or whether she be
of those who are not rightly directed <i>to the knowledge of
that which is altered. He desired thereby to try her intelligence.
So they altered it, by adding to it, or taking from
it, or in some other manner.</i> And when she came, it was
said <i>unto her</i>, Is thy throne like this? She answered, As
though it were the same. (<i>She answered them ambiguously
like as they had questioned her ambiguously, not saying, Is
this thy throne?&mdash;and had they so said, she had answered,
Yes.</i>) <i>And when Solomon saw her knowledge, he said</i>, And
we have had knowledge bestowed on us before her, and
have been Muslims. But what she worshipped instead
of God hindered her <i>from worshipping Him</i>; for she was
of an unbelieving people.&mdash;It was said unto her <i>also</i>,
Enter the palace. <i>It had a floor of white, transparent
glass, beneath which was running water, wherein were fish.
Solomon had made it on its being said unto him that her
legs and feet were</i> [hairy] <i>like the legs of an ass.</i> And when
she saw it, she imagined it to be a great water, and she
uncovered her legs, <i>that she might wade through it; and
Solomon was on his throne at the upper end of the palace,
and he saw that her legs and her feet were handsome</i>. He
said <i>unto her</i>, Verily it is a palace evenly spread with
glass. <i>And he invited her to embrace El-Isl&aacute;m</i>, [whereupon]
she said, O my Lord, verily I have acted unjustly towards
mine own soul, <i>by worshipping another than Thee</i>, and I
resign myself, with Solomon, unto God, the Lord of the
worlds. <i>And he desired to marry her; but he disliked the
hair upon her legs; so the devils made for him the depilatory
of quick-lime, wherewith she removed the hair, and he married
her; and he loved her, and confirmed her in her kingdom.
He used to visit her every month once, and to remain with
her three days; and her reign expired on the expiration of</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg&nbsp;144]</a></span>
<i>the reign of Solomon. It is related that he began to reign
when he was thirteen years of age, and died at the age of
three and fifty years. Extolled be the perfection of Him to
the duration of whose dominion there is no end!</i></p>

<p class="name">(xxvii. 15-45.)</p>

<p><i>We subjected</i> unto Solomon the wind, which travelled
in the morning (<i>unto the period when the sun began to
decline</i>) <i>the distance of</i> a month&#8217;s <i>journey</i>, and in the evening
<i>from the commencement of the declining of the sun into
its setting</i> a month&#8217;s <i>journey</i>. And We made the fountain
of molten brass to flow for him <i>three days with their nights</i>
[in every month], <i>as water floweth;<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> and the people worked
until the day</i> [of its flowing], <i>with that which had been given
into Solomon</i>. And of the jinn [were] those who worked
in his presence, by the will of his Lord; and such of them
as swerved from <i>obedience to</i> Our command We will cause
to taste of the punishment of hell <i>in the world to come</i> (<i>or,
as it is said by some, We cause to taste of its punishment in
the present world, an angel beating them with a scourge from
hell, the stripe of which burneth them</i>). They made for him
whatever he pleased, of lofty halls (<i>with steps whereby to
ascend to them</i>), and images (<i>for they were not forbidden by
his law</i><a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a>), and large dishes, like great tanks for watering
camels, <i>around each of which assembled a thousand men,
eating from it</i>, and cooking-pots standing firmly <i>on their
legs, cut out from the mountains in El-Yemen, and to which
they ascended by ladders</i>. <i>And We said</i>, Work, O family of
David, <i>in the service of God</i>, with thanksgiving <i>unto Him
for what He hath given you</i>:&mdash;but few of My servants are
the thankful. And when We decreed that he (<i>namely,
Solomon</i>) should die, <i>and he died, and remained standing,
and leaning upon his staff for a year, dead, the jinn meanwhile</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg&nbsp;145]</a></span>
<i>performing those difficult works as they were accustomed
to do, not knowing of his death, until the worm ate his staff,
whereupon he fell down</i>, nothing showed them his death
but the eating reptile (<i>the worm</i>) that ate his staff.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> And
when he fell down, the jinn plainly perceived that if they
had known things unseen (<i>of which things was the death of
Solomon</i>), they had not continued in the ignominious
affliction (<i>that is, in their difficult works</i>), <i>imagining that he
was alive, inconsistently with their opinion that they knew
things unseen. And that the period was a year was known
by calculating what the worm had eaten of his staff since
his death in each day and night or other space of time.</i>

<h3><i>JONAH.</i></h3>

<p>Verily Jonah [Yoonus] was one of the apostles. [Remember]
when he fled unto the laden ship, <i>being angry with
his people, because the punishment wherewith he had threatened
them did not fall upon them; wherefore he embarked in the
ship; and it became stationary in the midst of the sea: so
the sailors said, Here is a slave who hath fled from his master,
and the lot will discover him</i>:&mdash;and he cast lots <i>with those
who were in the ship</i>, and he was [the] one upon whom the
lot fell. <i>They therefore cast him into the sea</i>, and the fish
swallowed him; and he was reprehensible, <i>for having gone
to the sea, and embarked in the ship, without the permission
of his Lord</i>. And had he not been of those who glorified
God (<i>by his saying often in the belly of the fish, There is no
god but Thou! I extol Thy perfection! Verily I have
been of the offenders!</i>), he had remained in his belly
until the day of resurrection.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> And We cast him on the
plain land, <i>the same day, or after three or seven days, or
twenty or forty days</i>; and he was sick; and We caused a
gourd plant<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> to grow up over him, <i>to shade him</i>. <i>It had a
trunk, contrary to what is the case of gourds in general, being
miraculously produced for him.</i><a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> <i>And a wild she-goat came</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg&nbsp;147]</a></span>
<i>to him evening and morning, of whose milk he drank until he
became strong.</i> And We sent him <i>after that, as before</i>, unto
<i>his people in Nineveh, in the land of El-Mo&#7779;il</i>, a hundred
thousand, or they were a greater number by <i>twenty or
thirty or seventy thousand</i>; and they believed <i>on beholding
the punishment wherewith they had been threatened</i>;<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a>
wherefore We allowed them enjoyment <i>of their goods</i> for
a time, <i>until the expiration of their terms of life</i>. (xxxvii.

<h3><i>EZRA.</i></h3>

<p>[Hast thou not considered] him who passed by a city
(<i>which was Jerusalem</i>), <i>riding upon an ass, and having with
him a basket of figs and a vessel of the juice of grapes</i> (<i>and
he was &acute;Ozeyr</i> [Ezra]), and it was falling down upon its
roofs, <i>Nebuchadnezzar having ruined it</i>? He said, <i>wondering
at the power of God</i>, How will God quicken this after
its death?&mdash;And God caused him to die for a hundred
years. Then He raised him to life: [and] He said <i>unto him</i>,
How long hast thou tarried <i>here</i>?&mdash;He answered I have
tarried a day, or part of a day.&mdash;<i>For he slept in the first
part of the day, and was deprived of his life, and was reanimated
at sunset.</i> He said Nay, thou hast tarried a
hundred years: but look at thy food and thy drink: they
have not become changed by time: and look at thine ass.&mdash;<i>And
he beheld it dead, and its bones white and shining.&mdash;We
have done this that thou mayest know</i>, and that We may
make thee a sign <i>of the resurrection</i> unto men. And look
at the bones <i>of thine ass</i>, how We will raise them; then
We will clothe them with flesh.&mdash;<i>So he looked at them, and
they had become put together, and were clothed with flesh, and
life was breathed into it, and it brayed.</i> Therefore when it
had been made manifest to him he said, I know that God
is able to accomplish everything. (ii. 261.)</p>

<h3><i>THE MESSIAH.</i></h3>

<p><i>Remember</i> when the wife of &acute;Imr&aacute;n<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> said, (<i>when she had
become aged, and desired offspring, wherefore she supplicated
God, and became sensible of pregnancy</i>,) O my Lord, verily
I devote unto Thee what is in my womb, to be dedicated
<i>to the service of Thy holy house</i>: then accept [it] from
me; for Thou art the Hearer <i>of prayer</i>, the Knower <i>of
intentions</i>. <i>And &acute;Imr&aacute;n perished while she was pregnant.</i>
And when she gave birth to it, (<i>namely her daughter; and
she was hoping that it might be a boy; since none but boys
were dedicated</i>,) she said, O my Lord, verily I have brought
forth a female, (and God well knew what she had brought
forth,) and the male is not as the female, <i>the latter not
being fit for the service</i> [of the temple]; and I have named
her Mary [Maryam]; and I beg thy protection for her and
her offspring from the accursed devil.<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> (<i>In the traditions</i>
[it is said], <i>No child is born but the devil hath touched it at
the time of its birth, wherefore it first raiseth its voice by
crying, excepting Mary and her son.</i><a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a>) And her Lord accepted
her (<i>that is, He accepted Mary from her mother</i>) with a
gracious acceptance, and caused her to grow with an
excellent growth, <i>as though she grew in a day as a child</i>
[generally] <i>groweth in a month</i>. <i>Her mother took her to
the doctors, the keepers of the Holy House, and said, Receive</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg&nbsp;150]</a></span>
<i>ye this devoted child. And they eagerly desired her, because
she was the daughter of their chief. But Zechariah said, I am
more worthy of having her; for her maternal aunt is with
me. They however replied, Nay, but we will cast lots.&mdash;So
they departed (and they were nine and twenty) to the river
Jordan, and cast their divining arrows on the understanding
that he whose arrow should become steady in the water and
rise should be</i> [acknowledged] <i>most worthy of her; and the
arrow of Zechariah became steady, and he took her, and
built for her a chamber in the temple, with stairs to which
no one ascended but himself. And he used to bring her her
food and her drink and her ointment; and used to find
with her the fruits of winter in summer, and the fruits of
summer in winter, as He&mdash;whose name be exalted!&mdash;hath
said</i>, And Zechariah maintained her. Whenever Zechariah
went in to her in the chamber, he found with her provisions.
He said, O Mary, whence came to thee this?
She answered, (<i>being then a little child</i>,) It is from God:
<i>He bringeth it to me from Paradise</i>: for God supplieth
whom He pleaseth without reckoning.</p>

<p>Then, <i>when he saw this, and knew that He who was able
to produce a thing out of its season was able to give a child
in old age, (and the people of his house had become extinct,)</i>
Zechariah supplicated his Lord, <i>when he had entered the
chamber to pray in the latter part of the night</i>. He said,
O my Lord, give me from Thee a good offspring (<i>a righteous
son</i>); for Thou art the Hearer of prayer.&mdash;And the angels
(<i>by which is meant Gabriel</i>) called to him as he stood
praying in the chamber (<i>that is, the temple</i>), saying, God
promiseth thee John [Ya&#7717;y&aacute;], who shall be a verifier of
[the] Word <i>which cometh</i> from God, (<i>that is, Jesus</i> [&acute;Eesa];
<i>for he is the Spirit of God, and was named</i> [the] <i>Word
because he was created by the word Be</i>,) and a chief, (<i>or one
followed</i>,) and chaste, and a prophet, of the righteous. (<i>It
is related that he neither did any sin nor intended any.</i>)&mdash;He
said, O my Lord, how shall I have a son, when old
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg&nbsp;151]</a></span>
age hath come upon me, <i>when I have attained the utmost
age, a hundred and twenty years</i>, and my wife is barren,
<i>and hath attained the age of eight and ninety</i>?&mdash;He
answered, <i>It shall be</i> thus. God will do what He
pleaseth.&mdash;He said, O my Lord, give me a sign.&mdash;He
replied, Thy sign [shall be] that thou shalt not speak
unto men for three days, except by signal; but remember
thy Lord often, and glorify [Him] in the evening and in
the morning. (iii. 31-36.)</p>

<p>And he went forth unto his people from the chamber,
and made a sign unto them, [as though he would say]
Glorify [God] in the morning and in the evening <i>as usual</i>.
<i>And he knew by his being prevented from speaking unto
them that his wife had conceived John. And after his birth,
by some years, God said unto him</i>, O John, receive the book
(<i>that is, the Law</i>) with resolution. And We bestowed on
him wisdom (<i>the gift of prophecy</i>) [when he was yet] a
child, <i>three years of age</i>, and compassion from Us <i>for mankind</i>,
and [a disposition to bestow] alms <i>upon them</i>. And
he was pious, and dutiful to his parents, and was not
proud [nor] rebellious <i>toward his Lord</i>; and peace <i>from
Us</i> [was] on him on the day when he was born, and on the
day of his death, and [shall be] on the day when he shall
be raised to life. (xix. 12-15.)</p>

<p>And <i>remember</i> when the angels (<i>that is, Gabriel</i>) said,
O Mary, verily God hath chosen thee and hath purified
thee and hath chosen thee above the women of the
peoples <i>of thy time</i>. O Mary, be devout towards thy
Lord and prostrate thyself and bow down with those who
bow down: <i>pray with those who pray</i>.&mdash;This is [one] of
the announcements of things unseen <i>by thee</i>: We reveal
it unto thee, <i>O Mo&#7717;ammad</i>; for thou wast not with them
when they cast their divining arrows <i>that it might appear
to them</i> which of them should rear Mary, and thou wast
not with them when they disputed together <i>as to rearing
her</i>.&mdash;<i>Remember</i> when the angels (<i>that is, Gabriel</i>) said, O
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg&nbsp;152]</a></span>
Mary, verily God promiseth thee [the] Word from Him,
whose name [shall be] the Messiah [El-Mesee&#7717;], Jesus the
son of Mary, honourable in this world <i>by his prophetic
office</i>, and in the world to come <i>by his intercession and
high stations</i>, and of those admitted near <i>unto God</i>; and
he shall speak unto men in the cradle, and when of full
age,<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> and [he shall be] of the righteous.&mdash;She said, O
my Lord, how shall I have a son, when a man hath not
touched me?&mdash;He answered, <i>It shall be</i> thus; God will
create what He pleaseth: when He determineth a thing,
He only saith unto it, Be,&mdash;and it is. And He will teach
him writing and wisdom and the Law and the Gospel,
and <i>constitute him</i> an apostle to the children of Israel, <i>in
youth or after adolescence</i>. <i>And Gabriel breathed into the
bosom of her shift; whereupon she conceived; and those
events of her history which are related in the Soorat Maryam</i>
[&#7730;ur. xix.] <i>happened</i>. (iii. 37-43.)</p>

<p>Relate in the book (<i>that is, the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n</i>) <i>the history of</i>
Mary, when she retired from her family to a place towards
the east, <i>in the house</i>, and she took a veil [to conceal herself]
from them; and We sent unto her our spirit <i>Gabriel</i>,
and he appeared unto her as a perfect man. She said, I
beg the Compassionate to preserve me from thee! If
thou be a pious person, <i>thou wilt withdraw from me</i>.&mdash;He
replied, I am only the messenger of thy Lord [to inform
thee] that He will give thee a pure son, <i>endowed with the
gift of prophecy</i>. She said, How shall I have a son, when
a man hath not touched me, and I am not a harlot? He
answered, Thus <i>shall it be: a son shall be created unto thee
without a father</i>. Thy Lord saith, This is easy unto Me;
and <i>thus shall it be</i> that We may make him a sign unto
men, <i>showing Our power</i>, and a mercy from Us <i>unto him
who shall believe in him</i>: for it is a thing decreed.&mdash;And
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg&nbsp;153]</a></span>
she conceived him; and she retired with him [yet unborn]
to a distant place <i>far from her family</i>; and the pains of
childbirth urged her to repair to the trunk of a palm-tree
<i>that she might lean against it</i>. <i>And she gave birth to the
child, which was conceived and formed and born in an hour.</i><a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a>
She said, Oh! would that I had died before this <i>event</i>,
and had been a thing forgotten [and] unnoticed!&mdash;But
he who was below her (<i>namely Gabriel, who was on a
lower place than she</i>) called to her, Grieve not. God hath
made below thee a rivulet: and shake thou towards thee
the trunk of the palm-tree (<i>which was dried-up</i>); it shall
let fall upon thee ripe dates, fresh-gathered: therefore
eat <i>of the dates</i>, and drink <i>of the water of the rivulet</i>, and
be of cheerful eye <i>on account of the child</i>: and if thou see
any one of mankind, <i>asking thee concerning the child</i>, say,
I have vowed unto the Compassionate an abstinence <i>from
speech with mankind respecting him and other matters</i>;
therefore I will not speak to-day unto a man <i>after this</i>.</p>

<p>And she brought him [namely the child] unto her
people, carrying him. They said, O Mary, thou hast
done a strange thing. O sister of Aaron, (<i>he was a righteous
man; and the meaning is, O thou who art like him in
chastity</i>,<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a>) thy father was not a man of wickedness, nor
was thy mother a harlot. <i>Then whence gottest thou this
child?</i>&mdash;And she made a sign <i>to them</i>, [pointing] towards
him, [namely the child, as though she would say,] <i>Speak
ye unto him.</i> They said, How shall we speak unto him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg&nbsp;154]</a></span>
who is in the cradle, an infant? He [however] said,
Verily I am the servant of God:<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> He hath given me the
book <i>of the Gospel</i>, and hath appointed me a prophet; and
He hath made me blessed wherever I shall be, and hath
commanded me to observe prayer and give alms as long
as I shall live, and <i>hath made me</i> dutiful to my mother,
and hath not made me proud [nor] wicked. And peace
<i>from God</i> [was] on me on the day when I was born, and
[will be] on the day when I shall die, and on the day
when I shall be raised to life.&mdash;This [was] Jesus the son
of Mary. <i>I have spoken</i> the saying of truth, concerning
which they (<i>namely the Christians</i>) doubt, <i>saying that Jesus
is the son of God</i>. It is not [meet] for God to get a son.
Extolled be His purity <i>from that</i> [imputation]! When He
decreeth a thing <i>that He desireth to bring into existence</i>,
He only saith unto it, Be,&mdash;and it is: <i>and thus He
created Jesus the son of Mary without a father</i>.&mdash;And <i>say</i>,
Verily God is my Lord and your Lord: therefore worship
ye Him: this is a right way, <i>leading to Paradise</i>. But
the sects have differed among themselves; <i>that is, the
Christians have differed concerning Jesus, as to whether he
be the son of God, or a deity with Him, or the third of three</i>.
And woe unto them who have disbelieved <i>in that which
hath been stated, or in other matters</i>, on account of the
assembly of a great day, <i>the day of resurrection, and its
terrors</i>. How will they hear, and how <i>will they</i> see, on
the day when they shall come unto Us <i>in the world to
come</i>! But the offenders to-day (<i>that is, in the present
world</i>) are in a manifest error: <i>they are deaf, so that they
hear not the truth; and blind, so that they see it not</i>.
And do thou, <i>O Mo&#7717;ammad</i>, warn them (<i>namely the unbelievers
of Mekkeh</i>) of the day of sighing (<i>the day of resurrection,
when the evil-doer shall sigh for his having neglected</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg&nbsp;155]</a></span>
<i>to do good in the present world</i>), when the command <i>for
their punishment</i> shall be fulfilled, while they (<i>in the present
world</i>) are in a state of heedlessness <i>with respect to it</i>, and
while they believe not <i>therein</i>. Verily We shall inherit
the earth and whomsoever are upon it (<i>the heedless and
others; they being destroyed</i>); and unto Us shall they be
brought back <i>to be recompensed</i>. (xix. 16-41.)</p>

<p><i>And when God sent him</i> [Jesus] <i>to the children of
Israel, he said unto them, Verily I am the apostle of God
unto you</i>; for I have come unto you with a sign from
your Lord; for I will make for you of earth the similitude
of a bird, and will breathe into it, and it shall be a
bird,<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> by the permission (<i>or will</i>) of God;<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> (<i>and he made
for them a bat; for it is the most perfect of birds in make;
and it flew, while they looked at it; but when it had gone
out of their sight, it fell down dead</i>;) and I will cure the
blind from his birth, and the leper; (<i>and he cured in one day
fifty thousand, by prayer, on the condition of faith</i>;) and I
will raise to life the dead, by the permission of God; (<i>this
he repeated to deny his divinity: and he raised to life &acute;&Aacute;riz</i>
[Lazarus] <i>a friend of his; and a son of the old woman,
and the daughter of the publican; and they lived, and
children were born to them; and Shem the son of Noah, who
died immediately</i>;) and I will tell you what ye eat and
what ye store up in your houses. Verily therein will be
a sign unto you, if ye be believers. And <i>I have come
unto you</i> as a verifier of that which was before me, of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg&nbsp;156]</a></span>
Law, and to make lawful unto you part of what was made
unlawful to you <i>therein</i>; (<i>and he made lawful to them, of
fish and fowls, whatsoever is without fin or spur; and it is
said that he made lawful all, and that &#8216;part&#8217; is used in
the sense of &#8216;the whole:&#8217;</i>) and I have come unto you with
a sign from your Lord; therefore fear ye God, and obey
me <i>in that which I command you, as to the confession of
the unity of God and the service of Him</i>. Verily God is
my Lord and your Lord; therefore worship Him. This
is [the] right way. <i>But they accused him of falsehood and
believed not in him.</i> And when Jesus perceived their
unbelief, he said, Who [will be] my helpers for God?
The apostles<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> answered, We [will be] the helpers of God.
We have believed in God; and bear thou witness, <i>O
Jesus</i>, that we are Muslims [or resigned]. O our Lord,
we have believed in that which Thou hast sent down <i>of
the Gospel</i>, and we have followed the Apostle, <i>Jesus</i>;
therefore write us down among those who bear witness <i>of
Thy unity and of the truth of Thine apostle</i>.&mdash;And they
(<i>that is, the unbelievers among the children of Israel</i>) devised
a stratagem <i>against Jesus, to slay him treacherously</i>; but
God devised a stratagem <i>against them; for He put the
likeness of Jesus upon one who intended his slaughter, and
they slew him; and Jesus was taken up</i> [into heaven],<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg&nbsp;157]</a></span>
and God is the best of those who devise stratagems....
<i>It is related that God sent a cloud to Jesus, and it took him
up; but his mother clung unto him and wept: whereupon
he said unto her, Verily the resurrection will unite us.&mdash;It
is also related that he will descend shortly before the resurrection
and judge according to the law of our prophet</i>
[Mo&#7717;ammad], <i>slay Antichrist and the swine, break the
cross, and impose the capitation-tax</i> [on unbelievers].&mdash;<i>Also,
that he will remain, according to one tradition, seven
years; according to another, forty years; and die, and be
prayed over: but it is probable that</i> [by the latter period]
<i>is meant the whole time of his tarrying upon the earth, before
the ascension and after</i>. (iii. 43&mdash;47.)</p>

<p><i>Remember</i> when the apostle said, O Jesus, son of Mary,
is thy Lord able to cause a table to descend unto us from
heaven?<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> He replied, Fear God, <i>in demanding signs</i>, if
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg&nbsp;158]</a></span>
ye be believers. They said, We desire that we may eat
therefrom, and that our hearts may be at ease <i>in consequence
of additional evidence</i>, and we may know, <i>with
increased knowledge</i>, that thou hast spoken truth unto us
<i>in asserting thyself to be a prophet</i>, and may be witnesses
thereof.&mdash;Jesus the son of Mary said, O God, our Lord,
cause a table to descend unto us from heaven, that it
(<i>namely the day of its descent</i>) may be unto us a festival,<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a>
unto the first of us and the last of us (<i>or those who shall
come after us</i>), and a sign from Thee <i>of Thy power, and of
my prophetic office</i>; and provide us with food <i>thereby</i>; for
Thou art the best of providers.&mdash;God said, <i>in reply to
him</i>, Verily I will cause it to descend unto you; but
whosoever of you shall disbelieve after <i>its descent</i>, I will
surely punish him with a punishment wherewith I will
not punish any [other] of the peoples.&mdash;<i>And the angels</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg&nbsp;159]</a></span>
<i>descended with it from heaven: upon it were seven cakes of
bread and seven fishes; and they ate of them until they
were satisfied. And in a tradition related by Ibn-&acute;Abb&aacute;s
it is said that the table brought down from heaven bread
and flesh, and they were commanded not to act deceitfully,
nor to store up for the morrow; but they</i> [that is, some of
the people] <i>did so, and were transformed into apes and
swine</i>. (v. 112-115.)</p>

<p>Propound unto them, as an example, the inhabitants
of the city <i>of Antioch</i>, when the apostles <i>of Jesus</i> came
unto it;<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> when We sent unto them two,<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> and they charged
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg&nbsp;160]</a></span>
them with falsehood; wherefore We strengthened <i>them</i>
with a third;<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> and they said, Verily we are sent unto
you. They replied, Ye are not [aught] save men like us,
and the Compassionate hath not revealed anything: ye
do nothing but lie. They said, Our Lord knoweth that
we are indeed sent unto you; and naught is imposed on
us but the delivering of a plain message, <i>shown to be true
by manifest proofs, namely the cure of him who hath been
born blind and of the leper and the sick, and the raising of
the dead</i>. [The people of Antioch] said, Verily we presage
evil from you; <i>for the rain is withheld from us on your
account</i>: if ye desist not, we will assuredly stone you,
and a painful punishment shall surely betide you from us.
[The apostles] replied, Your evil luck is with you <i>because
of your unbelief</i>. If ye have been warned, <i>will ye presage
evil and disbelieve</i>? Nay, ye are an exorbitant people.&mdash;And
there came from the furthest part of the city a man
(<i>namely &#7716;abeeb the carpenter, who had believed in the
apostles</i>) running: he said, O my people, follow the
apostles: follow those who ask not of you a recompense,
and who are rightly directed. <i>And it was said unto
him, Art thou of their religion? He replied</i>, And
why should I not worship Him who hath created me, and
unto whom ye shall be brought back <i>after death</i>? Shall
I take deities beside Him? If the Compassionate be
pleased to afflict me, their intercession will not avert from
me aught, nor will they deliver. Verily, in that case (<i>if I
worshipped aught but God</i>), I should be in a manifest
error. Verily I believe in your Lord; therefore hear
ye me.&mdash;<i>But they stoned him, and he died;<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> and</i> it was
said <i>unto him at his death</i>, Enter thou into Paradise.
<i>And it is said that he entered it alive.</i> He said, O would
that my people knew my Lord&#8217;s forgiveness of me and
His having made me [one] of those who are honoured?&mdash;And
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg&nbsp;161]</a></span>
We sent not down against his people after him (<i>that
is, after his death</i>) an army <i>of angels</i> from heaven <i>to
destroy them</i>, nor were We sending down <i>angels to destroy
any one</i>. It (<i>namely their punishment</i>) was naught but
one cry <i>which Gabriel uttered against them</i>; and lo, they
were extinct. (xxxvi. 12-28.)</p>

<p><i>We have cursed the Jews</i> ... for their disbelief <i>in Jesus</i>
and their uttering against Mary a great calumny and
their saying, We have killed the Messiah, Jesus the son
of Mary, the apostle of God,&mdash;Yet they killed him not
nor crucified him; but one (<i>namely the person whom they
crucified</i>) was made to appear to them like <i>Jesus</i>; and
verily those who disagreed respecting him were in doubt
concerning him, <i>or his slaughter; for some of them said,
when they saw the slain person, The face is the face of
Jesus; but the body is not his body:&mdash;and others said, It
is he</i>:<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a>&mdash;they had no knowledge of him; but only
followed an opinion. And they did not really kill him;
but God took him up unto Himself; and God is mighty
[and] wise. And there is not of the people of the
Scripture <i>one</i> but he shall assuredly believe in him
(<i>namely Jesus</i>) before his death; <i>that is, before his own
death, or before the death of Jesus, when he descendeth shortly
before the resurrection</i>;<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a> and on the day of resurrection
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg&nbsp;162]</a></span>
he (<i>namely Jesus</i>) shall be a witness against them
(iv. 155-157.)</p>

<p>When God shall say, <i>on the day of resurrection</i>, O
Jesus, son of Mary, hast thou said unto men, Take me
and my mother as two deities, beside God?&mdash;<i>Jesus</i> shall
answer, <i>after being agitated</i> (<i>or after it shall have thundered</i>),
Extolled be Thy purity <i>from the imputation of aught
that is unsuitable to Thee, as the having a partner, and other
things</i>! It is not for me to say that which is not right
for me. Had I said it, Thou hadst known it. Thou
knowest what is in me; but I know not what is in
Thee; for Thou well-knowest things unseen. I said not
unto them aught but that which Thou commandedst me;
<i>namely</i> Worship ye God, my Lord and your Lord;&mdash;and
I was a watcher over them, <i>commanding them to abstain
from what they said</i>, while I remained among them: but
since Thou hast taken me to Thyself,<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> Thou hast been the
watcher over them, and Thou art the witness of all
things. If Thou punish them, (<i>that is, such of them as
have continued in unbelief</i>,) they are Thy servants <i>and
Thou mayest do with them as Thou pleasest</i>; and if Thou
forgive them, (<i>that is, such of them as have believed</i>,) Thou
art the Mighty, the Wise. (v. 116-118.)</p>

<p>When the son of Mary was proposed as an instance
(<i>when the saying of God was revealed, Verily ye and what
ye worship beside God</i> [shall be] <i>fuel of hell</i> [Kur. xxi.
98], <i>and the polytheists said, We are content for our gods
to be with Jesus, for he hath been worshipped beside God</i>,<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a>)
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg&nbsp;163]</a></span>
lo, thy people, <i>the polytheists</i>, cried out <i>in joy</i> thereat, and
they said, [Are] our gods better, or [is] he? <i>We are content
for our gods to be with him.</i>&mdash;They proposed not it
(<i>namely the instance</i>) unto thee otherwise than as a cause
of dispute (<i>knowing that the word &#8216;what&#8217; applieth to that
which is not endowed with reason; so that it doth not reflect
upon Jesus, on whom be peace!</i>): yea, they are a contentious
people. He (<i>namely Jesus</i>) is no other than a
servant whom We favoured <i>with the gift of prophecy</i>; and
We proposed him, <i>by reason of his having come into existence
without a father</i>, as an instance <i>of the divine power</i> unto
the children of Israel. And if We pleased, We would
substitute for you angels to succeed in the earth.<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> And
verily he (<i>namely Jesus</i>) <i>shall be</i> a sign of the [last]
hour:<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> <i>it shall be known by his descending</i>: wherefore
doubt not thereof.&mdash;And <i>say unto them</i>, Follow ye me <i>in
confessing the unity of God</i>: this, <i>which I command you to
follow</i>, is a right way. And let not the devil turn you
away <i>from the religion of God</i>; for he is unto you a manifest
enemy.&mdash;And when Jesus came with manifest proofs
(<i>with miracles and ordinances</i>), he said, I have come unto
you with wisdom (<i>with prophecy and with the ordinances
of the Gospel</i>), and to explain unto you part of [the things]
concerning which ye disagree: therefore fear ye God, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg&nbsp;164]</a></span>
obey me. Verily God is my Lord and your Lord;
wherefore worship ye Him: this is a right way.&mdash;But
the parties disagreed among themselves <i>respecting Jesus,
whether he were God, or the son of God, or the third of three</i>:
and woe unto them that transgressed <i>in that which they
said respecting Jesus</i>, because of the punishment of an
afflicting day! (xliii. 57-65.)</p>

<p>Verily the similitude of Jesus in the sight of
God is as the similitude of Adam. He created him
(<i>Adam</i>) of earth: then He said unto him, Be,&mdash;and he
was. <i>In like manner he said unto Jesus, Be, without a
father,&mdash;and he was.</i> <i>This is</i> the truth from thy Lord:
therefore be not thou of those who doubt. And whosoever
<i>of the Christians</i> argueth with thee respecting him, after
the knowledge that hath come unto thee <i>concerning him</i>,
say, Come ye, let us call our sons and your sons and our
wives and your wives, and ourselves and yourselves <i>will
assemble</i>: then we will invoke, and will lay the curse of
God on those who lie, <i>saying, O God, curse the liar respecting
the nature of Jesus!&mdash;And the prophet invited a
company from Nejr&aacute;n to do so, when they had argued with
him respecting Jesus; and they said</i>, [Wait] <i>until we consider
our case: then we will come unto thee. And their
counsellor said, Ye know his prophetic office, and that no
people have execrated a prophet but they have perished.
They however quieted the man, and departed, and came
unto the prophet. And he had come forth, having with him
El-&#7716;asan and El-&#7716;oseyn and F&aacute;&#7789;imeh and &acute;Alee; and he
said unto them, When I pray, say ye Amen. But they
refused to execrate, and made peace with him on the condition
of their paying tribute.</i>&mdash;Verily this is indeed the true
history, and there is no deity but God, and verily God is
indeed the Mighty, the Wise. (iii. 52-55.)</p>

<p>O people of the Scripture (<i>that is, of the Gospel</i>), exceed
not the just bounds in your religion,<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> nor say of God
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg&nbsp;165]</a></span>
[aught] but the truth. The Messiah, Jesus the son of
Mary, [was] only the apostle of God, and His Word, which
he transmitted unto Mary, and a spirit (<i>that is, a being
possessing a spirit</i>) from Him. (<i>He is mentioned in conjunction
with God, in order to show him honour, and is not,
as ye assert, the son of God, or a God with Him, or the third
of three; for the being possessing a spirit is compound, and
the Deity must be confessed to be pure from the imputation
of composition and the relationship of a compound being to
Him.</i>) Therefore believe in God and His apostles, and
say not, <i>There are</i> three <i>gods, God and Jesus and his
mother</i>.<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> Abstain <i>from this, and say what will be</i> better
for you; <i>that is, assert the unity of God</i>. God is only one
god. Extolled be His purity from the imputation of His
having a son! To Him belongeth whatsoever is in the
heavens and whatsoever is in the earth: and God is a
sufficient witness <i>thereof</i>. The Messiah doth not disdain
to be a servant unto God, nor do the angels who are
admitted near <i>unto Him</i>. (iv. 169, 170.)</p>

incapable of the genius of the old

the ancient poetry appeared almost
as exotic to their ideas as it does to
our own. No greater mistake can be
made than to judge of the old poets
by such a writer as Beh&aacute;-ed-deen
Zoheyr, of whom Professor E. H.
Palmer has lately given us so beautiful
a version. There is nothing in

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16" id="Footnote_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> The following is an abridgment: cp. Muir 485, and the <i>Seeret-er-Rasool</i>,
tr. Weil, ii. 316, 317.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17" id="Footnote_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> An attempt has been made to explain
away Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s fidelity to
Khadeejeh, by adducing the motive
of pecuniary prudence. Mo&#7717;ammad,
they say, was a poor man, Khadeejeh
rich and powerfully connected; any
<i>affaire de c&oelig;ur</i> on the husband&#8217;s part
would have been followed by a divorce
and the simultaneous loss of property
and position. It is hardly necessary
to point out that the fear of poverty&mdash;a
matter of little consequence in
Arabia and at that time&mdash;would not
restrain a really sensual man for five-and-twenty
years; especially when it
is by no means certain that Khadeejeh,
who loved him with all her heart
in a motherly sort of way, would have
procured a divorce for any cause soever.
And this explanation leaves
Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s loving remembrance of
his old wife unaccounted for. If her
money alone had curbed him for
twenty-five years, one would expect
him at her death to throw off the
cloak, thank Heaven for the deliverance,
and enter at once upon the rake&#8217;s
progress. He does none of those
things. The story of Zeyneb, the
divorced wife of Zeyd, is a favourite
weapon with Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s accusers.
It is not one to enter upon here; but
I may say that the lady&#8217;s own share
in the transaction has never been sufficiently
considered. In all probability
Zeyd, the freed slave, was glad
enough to get rid of his too well-born
wife, and certainly he bore no rancour
against Mo&#7717;ammad. The real point
of the story is the question of forged
revelations, which is discussed below.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18" id="Footnote_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> &#8216;The Prophet said: Whosoever
shall bear witness that there is one
God; and that Mo&#7717;ammad is His servant
and messenger; and that Jesus
Christ is His servant and messenger,
and that he is the son of the hand-maid
of God, and that he is the Word
of God, the word which was sent to
Mary, and Spirit from God; and
[shall bear witness] that there is truth
in Heaven and Hell, will enter into
paradise, whatever sins he may be
chargeable with.&#8217;&mdash;<i>Mishk&aacute;t-el-Mas&aacute;beeh</i>,

hardly be possible to gain a thorough

This expression alludes to a tradition,
that Abraham, when the devil tempted
him to disobey God, in not sacrificing
his son, drove the fiend away by throwing
stones at him; in memory of which,
the Mo&#7717;ammadans, at the pilgrimage
of Mecca, throw a certain number of
stones at the devil, with certain ceremonies,
in the valley of Mina.&mdash;S.
The devils, or evil jinn, it is said,
had liberty to enter any of the seven
heavens till the birth of Jesus, when
they were excluded from three of
them; on the birth of Mo&#7717;ammad
they were forbidden the other four.
They continue, however, to ascend
to the confines of the lowest heaven,
and there, listening to the conversation
of the angels respecting things
decreed by God, obtain knowledge of
futurity, which they sometimes impart
to men, who by means of talismans
or certain invocations make them
to serve the purposes of magical performances.
Shooting stars are often
hurled at the devils when they thus
listen.</p></div>

which have been from time to time
sent by God into the world amounts
to no less than 224,000, according to
one Mo&#7717;ammadan tradition, or to
124,000 according to another; among
whom 313 were apostles, sent with
special commissions to reclaim mankind
from infidelity and superstition;
and six of them brought new laws or
dispensations, which successively
abrogated the preceding: these were
Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus,
and Mo&#7717;ammad. All the prophets
in general the Mo&#7717;ammadans believe
to have been free from great
sins and errors of consequence, and
professors of one and the same religion,
that is, El-Isl&aacute;m, notwithstanding
the different laws and institutions
which they observed. In this
great number of prophets, they not
only reckon divers patriarchs and
persons named in Scripture but not
recorded to have been prophets
(wherein the Jewish and Christian
writers have sometimes led the way),
as Adam, Seth, Lot, Ishmael, Nun,
Joshua, &amp;c., and introduce some of
them under different names, as
Enoch, Heber, and Jethro, who are
called in the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n, Idrees, Hood,
and Sho&acute;eyb; but several others
whose very names do not appear in
Scripture (though they endeavour to
find some persons there to fix them
on), as &#7778;&aacute;li&#7717;, El-Khi&#7693;r, Dhu-l-Kifl.
</p><p>
As to the Scriptures, the Mo&#7717;ammadans
are taught by the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n
that God, in divers ages of the
world, gave revelations of His will in
writing to several prophets, the
whole and every word of which it is
absolutely necessary for a good Muslim
to believe. The number of these
sacred books was, according to them,
104; of which ten were given to
Adam, fifty to Seth, thirty to Idrees
or Enoch, ten to Abraham; and the
other four, being the Pentateuch,
the Psalms, the Gospel, and the
&#7730;ur-&aacute;n, were successively delivered
to Moses, David, Jesus, and Mo&#7717;ammad;
which last being the <i>seal</i> of
the prophets, those revelations are
now closed and no more are to be
expected. All these divine books,
except the four last, they agree to be
now entirely lost and their contents
unknown; though the Sabians have
several books which they attribute
to some of the antediluvian prophets.
And of those four, the Pentateuch,
Psalms, and Gospel, they say, have
undergone so many alterations and
corruptions, that though there may
possibly be some part of the true
word of God therein, yet no credit
is to be given to the present copies
in the hands of the Jews and Christians.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_193" id="Footnote_193"></a><a href="#FNanchor_193"><span class="label">[193]</span></a> The Mo&#7717;ammadans say, that
when they were cast down from
Paradise [which is in the seventh
heaven], Adam fell on the isle of
Ceylon, or Sarandeeb, and Eve near
Juddah (the port of Mekkeh) in
Arabia; and that, after a separation
of two hundred years, Adam was, on
his repentance, conducted by the
angel Gabriel to a mountain near
Mekkeh, where he found and knew
his wife, the mountain being thence
named &acute;Araf&aacute;t; and that he afterwards
retired with her to Ceylon.&mdash;S.</p></div>

this offering is thus related, according
to the common tradition in the
East. Each of them being born with
a twin-sister, when they were grown
up, Adam by God&#8217;s direction ordered
Cain to marry Abel&#8217;s twin-sister,
and Abel to marry Cain&#8217;s;
(for it being the common opinion
that marriages ought not to be
had in the nearest degrees of
consanguinity, since they must necessarily
marry their sisters, it
seemed reasonable to suppose they
ought to take those of the remoter
degree;) but this Cain refusing to
agree to, because his own sister was
the handsomest, Adam ordered them
to make their offerings to God, thereby
referring the dispute to His determination.
The commentators
say Cain&#8217;s offering was a sheaf of
the very worst of his corn; but
Abel&#8217;s a fat lamb of the best of his
flock.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_198" id="Footnote_198"></a><a href="#FNanchor_198"><span class="label">[198]</span></a> Or, as the original literally
signifies, boiled over [or boiled],
which is consonant to what the
Rabbins say, that the waters of the
deluge were boiling hot.&mdash;This oven
was, as some say, at El-Koofeh, in
a spot whereon a mosque now stands;
or, as others rather think, in a certain
place in India, or else at &acute;Eyn-el-Wardeh
in Mesopotamia. Some
pretend that it was the same oven
which Eve made use of to bake her
bread in, being of a form different
from those we use, having the mouth
in the upper part, and that it descended
from patriarch to patriarch
till it came to Noah. It is remarkable
that Mo&#7717;ammad, in all probability,
borrowed this circumstance
from the Persian Magi, who also
fancied that the first waters of the
deluge gushed out of the oven of a
certain old woman named Zala C&ucirc;fa.&mdash;But
the word &#8220;tennoor,&#8221; which is
here translated &#8220;oven,&#8221; also signifying
&#8220;the superficies of the earth,&#8221; or
&#8220;a place whence waters spring forth,&#8221;
or &#8220;where they are collected,&#8221; some
suppose it means no more in this
passage than the spot or fissure
whence the first eruption of waters
broke forth.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_199" id="Footnote_199"></a><a href="#FNanchor_199"><span class="label">[199]</span></a> It is a custom of many Muslims
to pronounce these words, &#8216;In the
name of God be its course and its
mooring,&#8217; on embarking for any
voyage.&mdash;L. The commentators tell
us that Noah was two years in building
the ark, which was framed of
Indian plane-tree; that it was divided
into three stories, of which
the lower was designed for the
beasts, the middle one for the men
and women, and the upper for the
birds; and the men were separated
from the women by the body of
Adam, which Noah had taken into
the ark. This last is a tradition of
the Eastern Christians.&mdash;S.</p></div>

Noah went into the ark on the tenth

tenth of Mo&#7717;arram; which therefore
became a fast: so that the whole

They chiefly worshipped four deities,
S&aacute;kiyeh, &#7716;&aacute;fi&#7693;hah, R&aacute;zi&#7731;ah, and
S&aacute;limeh; the first, as they imagined,
supplying them with rain, the second
preserving them from all dangers
abroad, the third providing food
for their sustenance, and the fourth
restoring them to health when
afflicted with sickness; according
to the signification of the several
names.&mdash;S.</p></div>

if he would kill the camel. Whereupon
he chose one, and with the
assistance of eight other men hamstrung
and killed the dam, and pursuing
the young one which fled to
the mountain, killed that also, and
divided his flesh among them.
Others tell the story somewhat differently,
adding &#7778;ada&#7731;ah Bint-El-Mukht&aacute;r

on the morrow their faces should become

that there are various opinions respecting
the age in which this person
lived: 1. That he lived in the first

the sons of Japheth, and was born in
the land of the Greeks: so said &acute;Alee;
2. That he was after Thamood: so
said El-&#7716;asan; 3. That he was of

so said Mu&#7731;&aacute;til; 4. That he lived
between the times of Moses and

Jesus and Mo&#7717;ammad; and 6. That
he was of the lineage of Yoon&aacute;n, son
[as some say] of Noah, in the days of
Abraham; and this, adds the author,
is the most correct.&mdash;But some suppose
him to be the same with Alexander

most obvious signification of which
is &#8216;the two-horned,&#8217; the more judicious

signifies &#8216;Lord of the two extreme
parts of the earth.&#8217;</p></div>

people made their irruptions into the

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_211" id="Footnote_211"></a><a href="#FNanchor_211"><span class="label">[211]</span></a> The Eastern authors unanimously
agree that he (&Aacute;zar) was a
statuary, or carver of idols; and he
is represented as the first who made
images of clay, pictures only having
been in use before, and taught that
they were to be adored as gods.
However, we are told his employment
was a very honourable one,
and that he was a great lord and
in high favour with Nimrod, whose
son-in-law he was, because he made
his idols for him and was excellent
in his art. Some of the Rabbins
say Terah was a priest and chief of
the order.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_212" id="Footnote_212"></a><a href="#FNanchor_212"><span class="label">[212]</span></a> Some tell us that Nimrod, on
seeing this miraculous deliverance
from his palace, cried out that he
would make an offering to the God
of Abraham; and that he accordingly
sacrificed four thousand kine.
[B.] But, if he ever relented, he
soon relapsed into his former infidelity:
for he built a tower that he
might ascend to heaven to see
Abraham&#8217;s God; which being overthrown
[&#7730;ur. xvi. 28], still persisting
in his design, he would be carried
to heaven in a chest borne by four
monstrous birds; but after wandering
for some time through the air,
he fell down on a mountain with
such force that he made it shake,
whereto (as some fancy) a passage
in the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n [xiv. 47] alludes,
which may be translated, &#8216;although
their contrivances be such as to
make the mountains tremble.&#8217;&mdash;Nimrod,
disappointed in his design
of making war with God, turned his
arms against Abraham, who, being
a great prince, raised forces to defend
himself; but God, dividing
Nimrod&#8217;s subjects, and confounding
their language, deprived him of
the greater part of his people, and
plagued those who adhered to him
by swarms of gnats, which destroyed
almost all of them; and one of those
gnats having entered into the nostril,
or ear, of Nimrod, penetrated to
one of the membranes of his brain,
where, growing bigger every day, it
gave him such intolerable pain, that
he was obliged to cause his head to
be beaten with a mallet, in order to
procure some ease, which torture he
suffered four hundred years; God
being willing to punish, by one of
the smallest of His creatures, him
who insolently boasted himself to
be lord of all. A Syrian calendar
places the death of Nimrod, as if
the time were well known, on the
eighth of Tamooz, or July.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_213" id="Footnote_213"></a><a href="#FNanchor_213"><span class="label">[213]</span></a> They tell us that Gabriel thrust
his wing under them and lifted
them up so high that the inhabitants

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_214" id="Footnote_214"></a><a href="#FNanchor_214"><span class="label">[214]</span></a> It is the most received opinion
among the Mo&#7717;ammadans that the
son whom Abraham offered was
Ishmael and not Isaac; Ishmael
being his only son at that time: for
the promise of Isaac&#8217;s birth is mentioned
lower, as subsequent in time
to this transaction. They also allege
the testimony of their prophet, who
is reported to have said, &#8216;I am the
son of the two who were offered in
sacrifice;&#8217; meaning his great ancestor,
Ishmael, and his own father &acute;Abd-Allah:
for &acute;Abd-el-Mu&#7789;&#7789;alib had
made a vow that if God would permit
him to find out and open the
well Zemzem and should give him
ten sons he would sacrifice one of
them; accordingly, when he had
obtained his desire in both respects,
he cast lots on his sons, and the lot
falling on &acute;Abd-Allah, he redeemed
him by offering a hundred camels,
which was therefore ordered to be
the price of a man&#8217;s blood in the
Sunneh.&mdash;S. (B., Z.)</p></div>

of &#8216;God is most Great!&#8217; etc.,
accompanied by particular postures;
part of the words being repeated in
an erect posture, part sitting, and

of the head and body, followed
by two prostrations, distinguishing
each rek&acute;ah. Each of the five daily

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_222" id="Footnote_222"></a><a href="#FNanchor_222"><span class="label">[222]</span></a> This well, say some, was a certain
well near Jerusalem, or not far
from the river Jordan; but others
call it the well of Egypt, or Midian.
The commentators tell us that when
the sons of Jacob had gotten Joseph
with them in the field, they began to
abuse and to beat him so unmercifully
that they had killed him had
not Judah on his crying out for help
insisted on the promise they had
made not to kill him but to cast him
into the well. Whereupon they let
him down a little way; but as he
held by the sides of the well, they
bound him, and took off his inner
garment, designing to stain it with
blood to deceive their father. Joseph
begged hard to have his garment
returned to him, but to no purpose,
his brothers telling him, with a sneer,
that the eleven stars and the sun and
the moon might clothe him and keep
him company.&mdash;S. (B., Z.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_223" id="Footnote_223"></a><a href="#FNanchor_223"><span class="label">[223]</span></a> The commentators pretend that
Gabriel also clothed him in the well
with a garment of silk of Paradise.
For they say that when Abraham was
thrown into the fire by Nimrod, he
was stripped; and that Gabriel
brought him this garment and put it
on him; and that from Abraham it
descended to Jacob, who folded it up
and put it into an amulet, which he
hung about Joseph&#8217;s neck, whence
Gabriel drew it out.&mdash;S. (B., Z.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_224" id="Footnote_224"></a><a href="#FNanchor_224"><span class="label">[224]</span></a> These races they used by way
of exercise; and the commentators
generally understand here that kind
of race wherein they also showed their
dexterity in throwing darts, which is
still used in the East.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_225" id="Footnote_225"></a><a href="#FNanchor_225"><span class="label">[225]</span></a> This Jacob had reason to suspect,
because when the garment was
brought to him, he observed that,
though it was bloody, yet it was not
torn.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

(B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_228" id="Footnote_228"></a><a href="#FNanchor_228"><span class="label">[228]</span></a> The expositors are not agreed
whether the pronoun <i>they</i> relates to
M&aacute;lik and his companions, or to
Joseph&#8217;s brethren. They who espouse
the former opinion say that those
who came to draw water concealed
the manner of their coming by him
from the rest of the caravan, that
they might keep him to themselves;
pretending that some people of the
place had given him to them to sell
for them in Egypt. And they who
prefer the latter opinion tell us that
Judah carried victuals to Joseph every
day while he was in the well; but
not finding him there on the fourth
day, he acquainted his brothers with
it: whereupon they all went to the
caravan and claimed Joseph as their
slave, he not daring to discover that
he was their brother, lest something
worse should befall him; and at
length they agreed to sell him to
them.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

friends. The occasion of Joseph&#8217;s imprisonment
is said to be either that
they suspected him to be guilty notwithstanding
the proofs which had
been given of his innocence, or else
that Zeleekha desired it, feigning, to
deceive her husband, that she wanted
to have Joseph removed from her
sight till she could conquer her passion
by time; though her real design
was to force him to compliance.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_231" id="Footnote_231"></a><a href="#FNanchor_231"><span class="label">[231]</span></a> According to the explication of
some who take the pronoun <i>him</i>
to relate to Joseph, this passage may
be rendered, &#8216;But the devil caused
him (<i>i.e.</i>, Joseph) to forget to make
his application unto his lord;&#8217; and
to beg the good offices of his fellow-prisoner
for his deliverance, instead
of relying on God alone, as it became
a prophet, especially, to have done.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_232" id="Footnote_232"></a><a href="#FNanchor_232"><span class="label">[232]</span></a> This prince, as the Oriental
writers generally agree, was Er-Reiy&aacute;n
the son of El-Weleed the Amalekite,
who was converted by Joseph to the
worship of the true God, and died in
the lifetime of that prophet. But
some pretend that the Pharaoh of
Joseph and of Moses were one and
the same person, and that he lived
(or rather reigned) four hundred
years.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_233" id="Footnote_233"></a><a href="#FNanchor_233"><span class="label">[233]</span></a> The commentators say that
Joseph, being taken out of prison,
after he had washed and changed his
clothes, was introduced to the king,
whom he saluted in the Hebrew
tongue, and on the king&#8217;s asking
what language that was, he answered
that it was the language of his fathers.
This prince, they say, understood no
less than seventy languages, in every
one of which he discoursed with
Joseph, who answered him in the
same; at which the king, greatly
marvelling, desired him to relate his
dream, which he did, describing the
most minute circumstances: whereupon
the king placed Joseph by him
on his throne, and made him his
Wezeer, or chief minister.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_234" id="Footnote_234"></a><a href="#FNanchor_234"><span class="label">[234]</span></a> Namely, Ephraim and Manasses:
so that according to this tradition,
she was the same woman who is called
Asenath by &#8216;Moses.&#8217; This supposed
marriage, which authorized their
amours, probably encouraged the
Mo&#7717;ammadan divines to make use
of the loves of Joseph and Zeleekha
as an allegorical emblem of the spiritual
love between the Creator and
the creature, God and the soul; just
as the Christians apply the Song of
Solomon to the same mystical purpose.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_235" id="Footnote_235"></a><a href="#FNanchor_235"><span class="label">[235]</span></a> Joseph, being made Wezeer,
governed with great wisdom; for he
not only caused justice to be impartially
administered and encouraged the
people to industry and the improvement
of agriculture during the seven
years of plenty, but began and perfected
several works of great benefit;
the natives at this day ascribing
to the patriarch Joseph almost all
the ancient works of public utility
throughout the kingdom; as particularly
the rendering the province
of El-Feiyoom, from a standing pool
or marsh, the most fertile and best-cultivated
land in all Egypt. When
the years of famine came, the effects
of which were felt not only in Egypt
but in Syria and the neighbouring
countries, the inhabitants were obliged
to apply to Joseph for corn,
which he sold to them, first for their
money, jewels, and ornaments, then
for their cattle and lands, and at
length for their persons; so that all
the Egyptians in general became
slaves to the king, though Joseph by
his consent soon released them and
returned them their substance.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_236" id="Footnote_236"></a><a href="#FNanchor_236"><span class="label">[236]</span></a> At length Joseph asked them
whom they had to vouch for their
veracity; but they told him they
knew no man who could vouch for
them in Egypt. Then, replied he,
one of you shall stay behind with me
as a pledge, and the others may
return home with their provision;
and when ye come again, ye shall
bring your younger brother with you,
that I may know ye have told me the
truth. Whereupon, it being in vain
to dispute the matter, they cast lots
who should stay behind, and the lot
fell upon Simeon. When they departed,
Joseph gave each of them a
camel, and another for their brother.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_237" id="Footnote_237"></a><a href="#FNanchor_237"><span class="label">[237]</span></a> The original word signifying
not only money but also goods bartered
or given in exchange for other
merchandise, some commentators tell
us that they paid for their corn, not
in money, but in shoes and dressed
skins.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_238" id="Footnote_238"></a><a href="#FNanchor_238"><span class="label">[238]</span></a> The belief in the influence of the
evil eye prevails among all the Muslims,
even the most religious and
learned; for their prophet said, &#8216;The
eye hath a complete influence; because
verily, if there were a thing to overcome
fate, it most certainly would be
a malignant eye.&#8217; Hence he permitted
charms (which he disallowed
in almost every other case) to be
employed for the purpose of counteracting
its influence.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_239" id="Footnote_239"></a><a href="#FNanchor_239"><span class="label">[239]</span></a> It is related that Joseph, having
invited his brethren to an entertainment,
ordered them to be placed two
and two together; by which means,
Benjamin, the eleventh, was obliged
to sit alone, and, bursting into tears,
said, If my brother Joseph were alive,
he would have sat with me. Whereupon
Joseph ordered him to be seated
at the same table with himself, and
when the entertainment was over,
dismissed the rest, ordering that they
should be lodged two and two in a
house, but kept Benjamin in his own
apartment, where he passed the night.
The next day, Joseph asked him
whether he would accept of himself
for his brother, in the room of him
whom he had lost; to which Benjamin
replied, &#8216;Who can find a
brother comparable unto thee? Yet
thou art not the son of Jacob and
Rachel.&#8217; And upon this, Joseph discovered
himself to him.&mdash;S. (B.).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_240" id="Footnote_240"></a><a href="#FNanchor_240"><span class="label">[240]</span></a> Some, however, are of opinion
that it was a drinking-cup.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_241" id="Footnote_241"></a><a href="#FNanchor_241"><span class="label">[241]</span></a> The occasion of this suspicion,
it is said, was that Joseph having
been brought up by his father&#8217;s sister,
she became so fond of him, that when
he grew up and Jacob designed to
take him from her she contrived the
following stratagem to keep him.
Having a girdle which had once belonged
to Abraham, she girt it about
the child, and then pretending she
had lost it, caused strict search to be
made for it; and it being at length
found on Joseph, he was adjudged,
according to the above-mentioned law
of the family, to be delivered to her
as her property. Some, however, say
that Joseph actually stole an idol of
gold, which belonged to his mother&#8217;s
father, and destroyed it; a story probably
taken from Rachel&#8217;s stealing
the images of Laban: and others tell
us that he once stole a goat or a hen,
to give to a poor man.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_242" id="Footnote_242"></a><a href="#FNanchor_242"><span class="label">[242]</span></a> Mi&#7779;r is the name both of Egypt and its capital.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_243" id="Footnote_243"></a><a href="#FNanchor_243"><span class="label">[243]</span></a> The injury they did Benjamin
was the separating him from his
brother, after which they kept him
in so great subjection that he durst
not speak to them but with the
utmost submission. Some say that
these words were occasioned by a
letter which Joseph&#8217;s brethren delivered
to him from their father,
requesting the releasement of Benjamin,
and by their representing his
extreme affliction at the loss of him
and his brother. The commentators
observe that Joseph, to excuse his
brethren&#8217;s behaviour towards him,
attributes it to their ignorance and
the heat of youth.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_244" id="Footnote_244"></a><a href="#FNanchor_244"><span class="label">[244]</span></a> The frontier town of Egypt towards Syria.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_245" id="Footnote_245"></a><a href="#FNanchor_245"><span class="label">[245]</span></a> El-Bey&#7693;&aacute;wee tell us that
Joseph sent carriages and provisions
for his father and his family; and
that he and the king of Egypt went
forth to meet them. He adds that
the number of the children of Israel
who entered Egypt with him was
seventy-two; and that when they
were led out thence by Moses, they
were increased to six hundred thousand
five hundred and seventy men,
and upwards, besides the old people
and children.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_246" id="Footnote_246"></a><a href="#FNanchor_246"><span class="label">[246]</span></a> A transposition is supposed to

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_247" id="Footnote_247"></a><a href="#FNanchor_247"><span class="label">[247]</span></a> But when Moses led the Israelites

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_248" id="Footnote_248"></a><a href="#FNanchor_248"><span class="label">[248]</span></a> The Mo&#7717;ammadan writers tell
us that Job was of the race of Esau,
and was blessed with a numerous
family and abundant riches; but
that God proved him by taking away
all that he had, even his children,
who were killed by the fall of a house;
notwithstanding which he continued
to serve God and to return Him
thanks as usual; that he was then
struck with a filthy disease, his body
being full of worms and so offensive
that as he lay on the dunghill none
could bear to come near him: that
his wife, however (whom some call
Ra&#7717;meh the daughter of Ephraim
the son of Joseph, and others Makhir
the daughter of Manasses), attended
him with great patience, supporting
him with what she earned by her
labour; but that the devil appearing
to her one day, after having reminded
her of her past prosperity, promised
her that if she would worship him,
he would restore all they had lost;
whereupon she asked her husband&#8217;s
consent, who was so angry at the proposal,
that he swore, if he recovered,
to give his wife a hundred stripes.&mdash;S.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_249" id="Footnote_249"></a><a href="#FNanchor_249"><span class="label">[249]</span></a> Some say there were two springs,

drank.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

the great riches which were bestowed
on Job after his sufferings, say he
had two threshing-floors, one for
wheat and the other for barley, and
that God sent two clouds, which
rained gold on the one and silver on
the other till they ran over.&mdash;(J.)
The traditions differ as to the continuance
of Job&#8217;s calamities: one
will have it to be eighteen years;
another, thirteen; another, three;
and another, exactly seven years
seven months and seven hours.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_253" id="Footnote_253"></a><a href="#FNanchor_253"><span class="label">[253]</span></a> The commentators generally suppose
him to be the same person with
the father-in-law of Moses, who is
named in Scripture Reuel or Raguel,
and Jethro. But A&#7717;mad Ibn-&acute;Abd-El-&#7716;aleem
charges those who entertain
this opinion with ignorance. They
say (after the Jews) that he gave his
son-in-law [Moses] that wonder-working
rod with which he performed all
those miracles in Egypt and the
Desert, and also excellent advice and
instructions; whence he had the
surname of &#8216;Kha&#7789;eeb-el-Ambiya,&#8217; or

(weak) signifying also in the &#7716;imyaritic

that Sho&acute;eyb was so, and that the

a defect which disqualified him for
the prophetic office.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_255" id="Footnote_255"></a><a href="#FNanchor_255"><span class="label">[255]</span></a> Which of the kings of Egypt this
Pharaoh of Moses was is uncertain.
Not to mention the opinions of the
European writers, those of the East
generally suppose him to have been
El-Weleed, who according to some
was an Arab of the tribe of &acute;&Aacute;d,
or according to others the son of
Mu&#7779;&acute;ab the son of Er-Reiy&aacute;n the
son of El-Weleed the Amalekite.
There are historians, however, who
suppose &#7730;&aacute;boos the brother and
predecessor of El-Weleed was the
prince we are speaking of, and pretend
he lived six hundred and
twenty years and reigned four hundred.
Which is more reasonable, at
least, than the opinion of those who
imagine it was his father Mu&#7779;&acute;ab or
grandfather Er-Reiy&aacute;n. Abu-l-Fida
says the Mu&#7779;&acute;ab, being one hundred
and seventy years old and having no
child, while he kept the herds saw a
cow calve, and heard her say at the
same time, &#8216;O Mu&#7779;&acute;ab, be not grieved,
for thou shalt have a wicked son,
who will be at length cast into hell.&#8217;
And he accordingly had this Weleed,
who afterwards coming to be king of
Egypt proved an impious tyrant.&mdash;S.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_256" id="Footnote_256"></a><a href="#FNanchor_256"><span class="label">[256]</span></a> This name is given to Pharaoh&#8217;s
chief minister; from whence it is
generally inferred that Mo&#7717;ammad
had been made Haman the favorite
of Ahasuerus king of Persia, and
who indisputably lived many years
after Moses, to be that prophet&#8217;s
contemporary.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_257" id="Footnote_257"></a><a href="#FNanchor_257"><span class="label">[257]</span></a> It is related that the midwife
appointed to attend the Hebrew
women, terrified by a light which
appeared between the eyes of Moses
at his birth, and touched with an
extraordinary affection for the child,
did not discover him to the officers,
so that his mother kept him in her
house, and nursed him three months;
after which it was impossible for
her to conceal him any longer, the
king then giving orders to make the
searches more strictly.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_258" id="Footnote_258"></a><a href="#FNanchor_258"><span class="label">[258]</span></a> The commentators say that his
mother made an ark of the papyrus,
and pitched it, and put in some cotton;
and having laid the child therein,
committed it to the river, a branch of
which went into Pharaoh&#8217;s garden:
that the stream carried the ark
thither into a fishpond, at the head
of which Pharaoh was then sitting
with his wife &Aacute;siyeh the daughter of
Muz&aacute;&#7717;em; and that the king, having
commanded it to be taken up and
opened, and finding in it a beautiful
child, took a fancy to it, and ordered
it to be brought up.&mdash;Some writers
mention a miraculous preservation of
Moses before he was put into the ark;
and tell us, that his mother having
hid him from Pharaoh&#8217;s officers in
an oven, his sister, in her mother&#8217;s
absence, kindled a large fire in the
oven to heat it, not knowing the
child was there; but that he was
afterwards taken out unhurt.&mdash;S.

Moses, having obtained leave of
Sho&acute;eyb or Jethro, his father-in-law,
to visit his mother, departed with his
family from Midian towards Egypt; but
coming to the valley of &#7788;uwa, wherein
Mount Sinai stands, his wife fell in
labour and was delivered of a son in
a very dark and snowy night: he had
also lost his way, and his cattle were
scattered from him, when on a sudden
he saw a fire by the side of a
mountain, which on his nearer
approach he found burning in a green
bush.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_265" id="Footnote_265"></a><a href="#FNanchor_265"><span class="label">[265]</span></a> This was a mark of humility
and respect: though some fancy
there was some uncleanness in the
shoes themselves, because they were
made of the skin of an ass not
dressed.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_266" id="Footnote_266"></a><a href="#FNanchor_266"><span class="label">[266]</span></a> Which was at first no bigger than
the rod, but afterwards swelled to a
prodigious size.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_267" id="Footnote_267"></a><a href="#FNanchor_267"><span class="label">[267]</span></a> When Moses saw the serpent
move about with great nimbleness
and swallow stones and trees, he was
greatly terrified, and fled from it; but
recovering his courage at these words
of God, he had the boldness to take
the serpent by the jaws.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_268" id="Footnote_268"></a><a href="#FNanchor_268"><span class="label">[268]</span></a> Moses had an impediment in his
speech, which was occasioned by the
following accident. Pharaoh one day
carrying him in his arms when a
child, he suddenly laid hold of his
beard and plucked it in a very rough
manner, which put Pharaoh into
such a passion that he ordered him
to be put to death: but &Aacute;siyeh his
wife representing to him that he was
but a child, who could not distinguish
between a burning coal and a ruby, he
ordered the experiment to be made;
and a live coal and a ruby being set
before Moses, he took the coal and
put it into his mouth, and burnt his
tongue: and thereupon he was pardoned.&mdash;This
is a Jewish story a little
altered.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_269" id="Footnote_269"></a><a href="#FNanchor_269"><span class="label">[269]</span></a> For he was obliged to abandon
his country and his friends, and to
travel several days in great terror
and want of necessary provisions to
seek a refuge among strangers; and
was afterwards forced to serve for
hire to gain a livelihood.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_270" id="Footnote_270"></a><a href="#FNanchor_270"><span class="label">[270]</span></a> Aaron being by this time come
out to meet his brother, either by
divine inspiration, or having notice
of his design to return to Egypt.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_271" id="Footnote_271"></a><a href="#FNanchor_271"><span class="label">[271]</span></a> The Arab writers tell enormous
fables of this serpent or dragon.
For they say that he was hairy and
of so prodigious a size that when he
opened his mouth his jaws were
fourscore cubits asunder and when
he laid his lower jaw on the ground
his upper reached to the top of the
palace [or rather, I believe, the
<i>throne</i> of Pharaoh]: that Pharaoh,
seeing this monster make towards
him, fled from it; and that the
whole assembly also betaking themselves
to their heels, no less than
twenty-five thousand of them lost
their lives in the press. They add
that Pharaoh, upon this abjured
Moses by God who had sent him to
take away the serpent, and promised
he would believe on Him and let
the Israelites go; but when Moses
had done what he requested, he
relapsed and grew as hardened as
before.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_272" id="Footnote_272"></a><a href="#FNanchor_272"><span class="label">[272]</span></a> There is a tradition that Moses
was a very swarthy man; and that
when he put his hand into his bosom,
and drew it out again, it became
extremely white and splendid, surpassing
the brightness of the sun.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_273" id="Footnote_273"></a><a href="#FNanchor_273"><span class="label">[273]</span></a> They provided themselves with
a great number of thick ropes and
long pieces of wood, which they
contrived by some means to move
and make them twist themselves one
over the other; and so imposed on
the beholders, who at a distance
took them to be true serpents. It
is also said that they rubbed them
over with quicksilver, which being
wrought upon by the heat of the sun
caused them to move.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_274" id="Footnote_274"></a><a href="#FNanchor_274"><span class="label">[274]</span></a> The expositors add that when
this serpent had swallowed up all
the rods and cords he made directly
towards the assembly and put them
into so great a terror that they fled
and a considerable number were killed
in the crowd: then Moses took it up
and it became a rod in his hand as
before. Whereupon the magicians
declared that it could be no enchantment,
because in such case their rods
and cords would not have disappeared.&mdash;S.
(B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_275" id="Footnote_275"></a><a href="#FNanchor_275"><span class="label">[275]</span></a> Sale observes that some writers
introduce only two of the enchanters
as acknowledging Moses&#8217; miracle to
be wrought by the power of God.
These two, they say, were brothers,
and the sons of a famous magician
then dead; but on their being sent
for to court on this occasion, their
mother persuaded them to go to
their father&#8217;s tomb and ask his
advice. Being come to the tomb,
the father answered their call, and
when they had acquainted him with
the affair, he told them that they
should inform themselves whether
the rod of which they spoke became
a serpent while its masters slept, or
only when they were awake; for,
said he, enchantments have no effect
while the enchanter is asleep, and
therefore if it be otherwise in this
case, you may be assured that they
act by a divine power. These two
magicians then, arriving at the capital
of Egypt, on inquiry found to their
great astonishment that when Moses
and Aaron went to rest their rod
became a serpent and guarded them
while they slept. And this was the first
step towards their conversion.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_276" id="Footnote_276"></a><a href="#FNanchor_276"><span class="label">[276]</span></a> Some think these converted
magicians were executed accordingly:
but others deny it, and say that the
king was not able to put them to
death; insisting on these words of the

they who follow you, shall overcome.&#8217;&mdash;S.</p></div>

employed no less than fifty thousand
men besides labourers in the building,
which they carried to so immense
a height that the workmen could no

ascending this tower threw a javelin
towards heaven, which fell back
again stained with blood, whereupon
he impiously boasted that he had
killed the god of Moses; but at sunset
God sent the angel Gabriel, who
with one stroke of his wing demolished
the tower, a part whereof
falling on the king&#8217;s army destroyed
a million of men.&mdash;S. (Z.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_281" id="Footnote_281"></a><a href="#FNanchor_281"><span class="label">[281]</span></a> Some are of opinion that those
who were sent by Pharaoh to seize
the true believer, his kinsman, are
the persons more particularly meant
in this place: for they tell us that
the said believer fled to a mountain,
where they found him at prayers,
guarded by the wild beasts, which
ranged themselves in order about
him; and that his pursuers thereupon
returned in a great fright to
their master, who put them to death
for not performing his command.&mdash;S.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_282" id="Footnote_282"></a><a href="#FNanchor_282"><span class="label">[282]</span></a> Some expound these words of

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_292" id="Footnote_292"></a><a href="#FNanchor_292"><span class="label">[292]</span></a> The story here alluded to, though
it occurs among passages respecting
Moses and his people, is said to relate
to a different age and to be as follows:&mdash;In
the days of David, some Israelites
dwelt at Eyleh, or Elath, on
the Red Sea, where, on the night of
the Sabbath, the fish used to come in
great numbers to the shore, and stay
there all the Sabbath, to tempt them;
but the night following they returned
into the sea again. At length, some
of the inhabitants, neglecting God&#8217;s
commandment, catched fish on the
Sabbath, and dressed and ate them;
and afterwards cut canals from the
sea, for the fish to enter, with sluices,
which they shut on the Sabbath, to
prevent their return to the sea. The
other part of the inhabitants, who
strictly observed the Sabbath, used
both persuasion and force to stop
this impiety, but to no purpose, the
offenders growing only more and more
obstinate; whereupon David cursed
the Sabbath-breakers, and God transformed
them into apes. It is said,
that one going to see a friend of his
that was among them found him in
the shape of an ape moving his eyes
about wildly; and asking him whether
he was not such a one, the ape made
a sign with his head that it was he;
whereupon the friend said to him,
Did not I advise you to desist? at
which the ape wept. They add, that
these unhappy people remained three
days in this condition, and were afterwards
destroyed by a wind which
swept them all into the sea.&mdash;S. (A. F.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_293" id="Footnote_293"></a><a href="#FNanchor_293"><span class="label">[293]</span></a> His breath before [he used the tooth-stick] had the odour of musk.&mdash;S.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_294" id="Footnote_294"></a><a href="#FNanchor_294"><span class="label">[294]</span></a> It is said that not only the ten
commandments, but the whole law
was written thereon.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_295" id="Footnote_295"></a><a href="#FNanchor_295"><span class="label">[295]</span></a> That is, as some understand it,
consisting of flesh and blood; or, as
others, being a mere body or mass of
metal, without a soul.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_296" id="Footnote_296"></a><a href="#FNanchor_296"><span class="label">[296]</span></a> The person who cast this calf, the
Mo&#7717;ammadans say, was not Aaron
but Es-S&aacute;miree, one of the principal
men among the children of Israel,
some of whose descendants, it is pretended,
still inhabit an island of that
name in the Arabian Gulf. It was
made of the rings and bracelets of
gold, silver, and other materials,
which the Israelites had borrowed of
the Egyptians; for Aaron, who commanded
in his brother&#8217;s absence,
having ordered Es-S&aacute;miree to collect
those ornaments from the people, who
carried on a wicked commerce with
them, and to keep them together till
the return of Moses, Es-S&aacute;miree, understanding
the founder&#8217;s art, put
them altogether into a furnace, to
melt them down into one mass, which
came out in the form of a calf. One
writer says, that all the Israelites
adored this calf, except only twelve
thousand.&mdash;S. (A. F.)</p></div>

knew not&mdash;that the messenger sent
to thee from God was a pure spirit,
and that his footsteps gave life
to whatever they touched; being
no other than the angel Gabriel,
mounted on the horse of life: and
therefore I made use of the dust of
his feet to animate the molten calf.
It is said, Es-S&aacute;miree knew the angel
because he had saved and taken care
of him when a child and exposed by
his mother for fear of Pharaoh.&mdash;S.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_299" id="Footnote_299"></a><a href="#FNanchor_299"><span class="label">[299]</span></a> The word here rendered &#8216;hearts&#8217;
often signifies stomachs; and if this
be its meaning here, the narrative
agrees with the [so-called] Mosaic
account: for Moses &#8216;took the calf
which they had made, and burnt it
in the fire, and ground it to powder,
and strawed it upon the water, and
made the children of Israel to drink
of it.&#8217;&mdash;Exod. xxxii. 20.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_300" id="Footnote_300"></a><a href="#FNanchor_300"><span class="label">[300]</span></a> The persons here meant are said
to have been seventy men, who were
made choice of by Moses, and heard
the voice of God talking with him.
But not being satisfied with that,
they demanded to see God; whereupon
they were all struck dead by
lightning, and on Moses&#8217; intercession
restored to life.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_301" id="Footnote_301"></a><a href="#FNanchor_301"><span class="label">[301]</span></a> This person is represented by the
commentators as the most beautiful

proverb.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_302" id="Footnote_302"></a><a href="#FNanchor_302"><span class="label">[302]</span></a> Moses, as some say, having complained
to God of a false accusation
brought against him by &#7730;&aacute;roon, He
directed him to command the earth
what he pleased, and it should obey
him; whereupon he said, &#8216;O earth,
swallow them up;&#8217; and immediately
the earth opened under &#7730;&aacute;roon and
his confederates, and swallowed them
up, with his palace and all his riches.&mdash;There
goes a tradition that as
&#7730;&aacute;roon sank gradually into the
ground, first to his knees, then to
his waist, then to his neck, he cried
out four several times, &#8216;O Moses,
have mercy on me!&#8217; but that Moses
continued to say, &#8216;O earth, swallow
them up!&#8217; till at last he wholly disappeared:
upon which God said to
Moses, &#8216;Thou hadst no mercy on
&#7730;&aacute;roon, though he asked pardon of
thee four times; but I would have
had compassion on him if he had
asked pardon of me but once.&#8217;&mdash;S.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_304" id="Footnote_304"></a><a href="#FNanchor_304"><span class="label">[304]</span></a> The story of this young man is
thus related:&mdash;A certain man at his
death left his son, then a child, a
cow-calf, which wandered in the
desert till he came to age; at which
time his mother told him the heifer
was his, and bid him fetch her and
sell her for three pieces of gold.
When the young man came to the
market with his heifer, an angel in
the shape of a man accosted him and
bid him six pieces of gold for her;
but he would not take the money till
he had asked his mother&#8217;s consent;
which when he had obtained, he
returned to the market-place, and
met the angel, who now offered him
twice as much for the heifer, provided
he would say nothing of it to
his mother; but the young man,
refusing, went and acquainted her
with the additional offer. The woman,
perceiving it was an angel, bid her
son go back and ask him what must
be done with the heifer; whereupon
the angel told the young man that
in a little time the children of Israel
would buy that heifer of him at any
price.&mdash;S. (A.F.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_305" id="Footnote_305"></a><a href="#FNanchor_305"><span class="label">[305]</span></a> The more common tradition
seems to be that the man was murdered
by <i>one</i> person, the son of his
brother, who desired to obtain his
property (as his inheritance), or his
daughter, or both. (Mir-&aacute;t-ez-Zem&aacute;n).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_306" id="Footnote_306"></a><a href="#FNanchor_306"><span class="label">[306]</span></a> Also called El-Kha&#7693;ir. This mysterious
person, whom the vulgar and
some others regard as a prophet, and
identify with Ily&aacute;s (Elias or Elijah),
and whom some confound with St.
George, was, according to the more
approved opinion of the learned, a
just man or saint, the Wezeer and
counsellor of that equally doubtful
personage Dhu-l-&#7730;arneyn, whose story
has already been related in this
volume. El-Khi&#7693;r is said to have
drunk of the Fountain of Life, by
virtue of which he still lives, and
will live till the day of judgment.
He is also said to appear frequently
to Muslims in perplexity, and to be
generally clad in green garments;
whence, according to some, his name.&mdash;Sale
states, in a note on this
passage, that the Muslims usually
confound El-Khi&#7693;r with Phineas, as
well as Elias and St. George, saying
that his soul passed by a metempsychosis
successively through all
three; and he adds, that part of
these fictions they took from the
Jews, some of whom also fancy
Phineas was Elias.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_308" id="Footnote_308"></a><a href="#FNanchor_308"><span class="label">[308]</span></a> They were ten brothers, five of
whom were past their labour by
reason of their age.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_309" id="Footnote_309"></a><a href="#FNanchor_309"><span class="label">[309]</span></a> That is, because of the great
confidence the Israelites placed in it,
having won several battles by its
miraculous assistance. I imagine,
however, that the Arabic word &#8216;sekeeneh,&#8217;
which signifies &#8216;tranquillity&#8217;
or &#8216;security of mind,&#8217; and is so understood
by the commentators, may
not improbably mean the &#8216;divine
presence&#8217; or &#8216;glory,&#8217; which used to
appear on the Ark, and which the
Jews express by the same word
&#8216;Shekinah.&#8217;&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_310" id="Footnote_310"></a><a href="#FNanchor_310"><span class="label">[310]</span></a> Sale observes that Ya&#7717;y&aacute; most
rationally understands hereby the
divine revelations which David received
from God, and not the art
of making coats of mail.&mdash;The cause
of his applying himself to this art is
thus related in the Mir-&aacute;t-ez-Zem&aacute;n:&mdash;He
used to go forth in disguise;
and when he found any people who
knew him not, he approached them
and asked them respecting the conduct
of David, and they praised him
and prayed for him; but one day, as
he was asking questions respecting
himself as usual, God sent to him an
angel in the form of a human being,
who said, &#8216;An excellent man were
David if he did not take from the
public treasury:&#8217;&mdash;whereupon the
heart of David was contracted, and
he begged of God to render him independent:
so He made iron soft to
him, and it became in his hands as
thread; and he used to sell a coat of
mail for four thousand [pieces of
money&mdash;whether gold or silver is not said]
and with part of this he obtained
food for himself, and part he
gave in alms, and with part he fed
his family.&mdash;Hence an excellent

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_311" id="Footnote_311"></a><a href="#FNanchor_311"><span class="label">[311]</span></a> For David, they say, divided
his time regularly, setting apart one
day for the service of God, another
day for rendering justice to his
people, another day for preaching to
them, and another day for his own
affairs.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_312" id="Footnote_312"></a><a href="#FNanchor_312"><span class="label">[312]</span></a> They say that he had a carpet
of green silk, on which his throne was
placed, being of a prodigious length
and breadth, and sufficient for all his
forces to stand on, the men placing
themselves on his right hand, and the
spirits [or jinn] on his left; and that
when all were in order the wind at
his command took up the carpet
and transported it with all that were
upon it wherever he pleased; the
army of birds at the same time
flying over their heads and forming a
kind of canopy to shade them from
the sun.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_314" id="Footnote_314"></a><a href="#FNanchor_314"><span class="label">[314]</span></a> After the space of forty days,
which was the time the image had
been worshipped in his house, the
devil [or jinnee] flew away, and threw
the signet into the sea: the signet
was immediately swallowed by a fish,
which being taken and given to Solomon,
he found the ring in its belly,
and, having by this means recovered
the kingdom, took &#7778;akhr, and, tying
a great stone to his neck, threw him
into the Lake of Tiberias.&mdash;S. (B.,
A.F.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_315" id="Footnote_315"></a><a href="#FNanchor_315"><span class="label">[315]</span></a> See note 30 to the Introduction of my translation of the &#8216;Thousand

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_316" id="Footnote_316"></a><a href="#FNanchor_316"><span class="label">[316]</span></a> The Arab historians tell us
that Solomon, having finished the
Temple of Jerusalem, went in
pilgrimage to Mekkeh, where having
stayed as long as he pleased, he proceeded
towards El-Yemen; and leaving
Mekkeh in the morning he
arrived by noon at &#7778;an&acute;a, and being
extremely delighted with the country
rested there; but wanting water
to make the ablution, he looked
among the birds for the lapwing
which found it for him.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_317" id="Footnote_317"></a><a href="#FNanchor_317"><span class="label">[317]</span></a> Some add that Bil&#7731;ees, to try
whether Solomon was a prophet or
not, drest the boys like girls and the
girls like boys, and sent him in a
casket a pearl not drilled and an
onyx drilled with a crooked hole;
and that Solomon distinguished the
boys from the girls by the different
manner of their taking water, and
ordered one worm to bore the pearl,
and another to pass a thread through
the onyx.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_318" id="Footnote_318"></a><a href="#FNanchor_318"><span class="label">[318]</span></a> Others, however, suppose it was
El-Khi&#7693;r, or else Gabriel, or some
other angel; and some imagine it to
have been Solomon himself.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_319" id="Footnote_319"></a><a href="#FNanchor_319"><span class="label">[319]</span></a> This fountain they say was in
El-Yemen.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_320" id="Footnote_320"></a><a href="#FNanchor_320"><span class="label">[320]</span></a> Some say these spirits made him
two lions, which were placed at the
foot of his throne; and two eagles,
which were set above it; and that
when he mounted it, the lions
stretched out their paws; and when
he sat down, the eagles shaded him
with their wings.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_321" id="Footnote_321"></a><a href="#FNanchor_321"><span class="label">[321]</span></a> The commentators to explain
this passage tell us that David,
having laid the foundations of the
Temple of Jerusalem, which was to
be in lieu of the tabernacle of Moses,
when he died, left it to be finished by
his son Solomon, who employed the
genii in the work; that Solomon, before
the edifice was quite completed,
perceiving his end drew nigh, begged
of God that his death might be concealed
from the genii till they had
entirely finished it; that God therefore
so ordered it that Solomon died
as he stood at his prayers, leaning on
his staff, which supported the body
in that posture a full year; and the
genii, supposing him to be alive, continued
their work during that term,
at the expiration whereof, the temple
being perfectly completed, a worm,
which had gotten into the staff, ate
it through, and the corpse fell to the
ground and discovered the king&#8217;s
death.&mdash;S. (B., Jel&aacute;l.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_322" id="Footnote_322"></a><a href="#FNanchor_322"><span class="label">[322]</span></a> It is said that the fish, after it
had swallowed Jonah, swam after the
ship with its head above water, that
the prophet might breathe; who continued
to praise God till the fish came
to land and vomited him out.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_323" id="Footnote_323"></a><a href="#FNanchor_323"><span class="label">[323]</span></a> Sale states that some imagine
Jonah&#8217;s plant to have been a fig; and
others, the m&oacute;z (or banana), which
bears very large leaves and excellent
fruit.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_324" id="Footnote_324"></a><a href="#FNanchor_324"><span class="label">[324]</span></a> The commentators add that
this plant withered the next morning,
and that Jonah being much concerned
at it God made a remonstrance
to him in behalf of the
Ninevites, agreeably to what is
recorded in Scripture.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_325" id="Footnote_325"></a><a href="#FNanchor_325"><span class="label">[325]</span></a> When he first began to exhort
them to repentance, instead of
hearkening to him, they used him
very ill, so that he was obliged to
leave the city, threatening them at
his departure that they should be
destroyed within three days, or, as
others say, within forty. But when
the time drew near, and they saw the
heavens overcast with a black cloud
which shot forth fire and filled the
air with smoke and hung directly
over the city, they were in a terrible
consternation, and getting into the
fields, with their families and cattle,
they put on sackcloth and humbled
themselves before God, calling aloud
for pardon and sincerely repenting
of their past wickedness. Whereupon
God was pleased to forgive
them, and the storm blew over.&mdash;S.
(B., Jel&aacute;l, A.F.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_326" id="Footnote_326"></a><a href="#FNanchor_326"><span class="label">[326]</span></a> &acute;Imr&aacute;n, as observed by Sale, is the
name of two several persons according
to the Muslims: one was the
father of Moses and Aaron, and the
other was the father of the Virgin
Mary. The latter is here meant, and
his wife&#8217;s name was Hannah.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_328" id="Footnote_328"></a><a href="#FNanchor_328"><span class="label">[328]</span></a> And for this reason, they say,
neither of them was guilty of any sin,
like the rest of the children of
Adam.&mdash;S. (&#7730;at&aacute;deh.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_329" id="Footnote_329"></a><a href="#FNanchor_329"><span class="label">[329]</span></a> That is, between thirty, or
thirty-four, and fifty-one: and the
passage may relate to Christ&#8217;s preaching
here on earth. But as he had
scarce attained this age when he was
taken up into heaven, the commentators
choose to understand it of his
second coming.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_330" id="Footnote_330"></a><a href="#FNanchor_330"><span class="label">[330]</span></a> The age of the Virgin Mary at
the time of her conception was thirteen,
or, as others say, ten; and she
went six, seven, eight, or nine months
with him, according to different traditions;
though some say the child was
conceived at its full growth of nine
months, and that she was delivered of
him within an hour after.&mdash;S. (B.,
Yahya.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_331" id="Footnote_331"></a><a href="#FNanchor_331"><span class="label">[331]</span></a> Some say the Virgin Mary had
really a brother named Aaron, who
had the same father but a different
mother: others suppose Aaron the
brother of Moses is here meant, but
say Mary is called his sister either because
she was of the Levitical race,
(as, by her having been related to
Elizabeth, it should seem she was,) or
by way of comparison: others say that
it was a different person of that name
who was contemporary with her and
conspicuous for his good or bad
qualities, and that they likened her
to him either by way of commendation
or of reproach.&mdash;S. (B., Z., &amp;c.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_332" id="Footnote_332"></a><a href="#FNanchor_332"><span class="label">[332]</span></a> These were the first words
which were put into the mouth of
Jesus, to obviate the imagination of
his partaking of the divine nature or
having a right to the worship of mankind
on account of his miraculous
speaking so soon after his birth.&mdash;S.
(B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_333" id="Footnote_333"></a><a href="#FNanchor_333"><span class="label">[333]</span></a> It is related in the spurious Gospel
of the Infancy of Christ that Jesus
being seven years old and at play
with several children of his age, they
made several figures of birds and
beasts of clay for their diversion;
and each preferring his own workmanship,
Jesus told them that he
would make his walk and leap; which
accordingly at his command they
did. He made also several figures of
sparrows and other birds, which flew
about or stood on his hands as he
ordered them, and also ate and drank
when he offered them meat and drink.
The children, telling this to their
parents, were forbidden to play any
more with Jesus, whom they held to
be a sorcerer.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_334" id="Footnote_334"></a><a href="#FNanchor_334"><span class="label">[334]</span></a> The commentators observe that
these words are added lest it should
be thought Jesus did these miracles
by his own power, or was God.&mdash;S.
(B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_335" id="Footnote_335"></a><a href="#FNanchor_335"><span class="label">[335]</span></a> In Arabic, &#8216;el-&#7716;aw&aacute;reeyoon;&#8217;
which word they derive from &#8216;&#7717;&aacute;ra,&#8217;
&#8216;to be white&#8217; [or rather, &#8216;to whiten&#8217;
clothes], and suppose the apostles
were so called either from the <i>candour</i>
and <i>sincerity</i> of their minds, or because
they were princes and wore
white garments, or else because they
were by trade fullers.&mdash;(B., Jel&aacute;l.)
According to which last opinion, their
vocation is thus related: That as
Jesus passed by the sea-side, he saw
some fullers at work, and, accosting
them, said, &#8216;Ye cleanse these clothes,
but cleanse not your hearts;&#8217; upon
which they believed on him. But
the true etymology seems to be from
the Ethiopic verb &#8216;hawyra,&#8217; &#8216;to go;&#8217;
whence &#8216;haw&acirc;rya&#8217; signifies &#8216;one that
is sent,&#8217; a &#8216;messenger,&#8217; or &#8216;apostle.&#8217;&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_336" id="Footnote_336"></a><a href="#FNanchor_336"><span class="label">[336]</span></a> The person crucified some will
have to be a spy that was sent to entrap
him; others that it was one
Titian, who by the direction of Judas
entered in at a window of the house
where Jesus was; to kill him; and
others that it was Judas himself,
who agreed with the rulers of the
Jews to betray him for thirty pieces
of silver, and led those who were
sent to take him.&mdash;They add, that
Jesus, after his crucifixion in <i>effigy</i>,
was sent down again to the earth to
comfort his mother and disciples and
acquaint them how the Jews were
deceived, and was then taken up a
second time into heaven.
</p><p>
It is supposed by several that
this story was an original invention
of Mo&#7717;ammad&#8217;s; but they are certainly
mistaken: for several sectaries
held the same opinion long before
his time. The Basilidians, in the
very beginning of Christianity, denied
that Christ himself suffered, but
[asserted] that Simon the Cirenean
was crucified in his place. The
Corinthians before them, and the
Carpocratians next (to name no more
of those who affirmed Jesus to have
been a mere man), did believe the
same thing, that it was not himself,
but one of his followers, very like
him, that was crucified. Photius
tells us that he read a book entitled
&#8216;The Journeys of the Apostles,&#8217; relating
the acts of Peter, John,
Andrew, Thomas, and Paul; and
among other things contained therein
this was one, that Christ was not
crucified, but another in his stead,
and that therefore he laughed at his
crucifiers, or those who thought they
had crucified him.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_337" id="Footnote_337"></a><a href="#FNanchor_337"><span class="label">[337]</span></a> This miracle is thus related by
the commentators. Jesus having at
the request of his followers asked it
of God, a red table immediately descended
in their sight between two
clouds and was set before them;
whereupon he rose up, and, having
made the ablution, prayed, and then
took off the cloth which covered the
table, saying, &#8216;In the name of God,
the best provider of food.&#8217; What the
provisions were with which the table
was furnished is a matter wherein
the expositors are not agreed. One
will have them to be nine cakes of
bread and nine fishes; another, bread
and flesh; another, all sorts of food
except flesh; another, all sorts of
food except bread and flesh; another,
all except bread and fish; another,
one fish which had the taste of all
manner of food; another, fruits of
Paradise: but the most received tradition
is that when the table was
uncovered there appeared a fish
ready dressed, without scales or
prickly fins, dropping with fat, having
salt placed at its head, and vinegar at
its tail, and round it all sorts of herbs
except leeks, and five loaves of bread,
on one of which there were olives, on
the second honey, on the third butter,
on the fourth cheese, and on the fifth
dried flesh. They add that Jesus
at the request of the apostles showed
them another miracle by restoring
the fish to life and causing its scales
and fins to return to it; at which
the standers-by being affrighted, he
caused it to become as it was before:
that one thousand three hundred men
and women, all afflicted with bodily
infirmities or poverty, ate of these
provisions and were satisfied, the
fish remaining whole as it was at the
first: that then the table flew up to
heaven in the sight of all; and every
one who had partaken of this food
were delivered from their infirmities
and misfortunes: and that it continued
to descend for forty days together,
at dinner-time, and stood on
the ground till the sun declined, and
was then taken up into the clouds.
Some of the Mo&#7717;ammadan writers
are of opinion that this table did not
really descend, but it was only a
parable; but most think that the
words of the &#7730;ur-&aacute;n are plain to the
contrary. A further tradition is
that several men were changed into
swine [and apes] for disbelieving this
miracle and attributing it to magic
art; or, as others pretend, for stealing
some of the victuals from off it.
Several other fabulous circumstances
are also told, which are scarce worth
transcribing.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_338" id="Footnote_338"></a><a href="#FNanchor_338"><span class="label">[338]</span></a> Some say the table descended
on a Sunday, which was the reason
of the Christians&#8217; observing that day
as sacred. Others pretend this day
is still kept among them as a very
great festival; and it seems as if the
story had its rise from an imperfect
notion of Christ&#8217;s last supper and
the institution of the Eucharist.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_339" id="Footnote_339"></a><a href="#FNanchor_339"><span class="label">[339]</span></a> To explain this passage, the
commentators tell the following story:&mdash;The
people of Antioch being idolaters,
Jesus sent two of his disciples
thither to preach to them; and when
they drew near the city, they found
&#7716;abeeb, surnamed En-Nejj&aacute;r, or The
Carpenter, feeding sheep, and acquainted
him with their errand;
whereupon he asked them what proof
they had of their veracity, and they
told him they could cure the sick
and the blind and the lepers; and to
demonstrate the truth of what they
said they laid their hands on a child
of his who was sick and immediately
restored him to health. &#7716;abeeb
was convinced by this miracle and
believed; after which they went into
the city and preached the worship of
one true God, curing a great number
of people of several infirmities; but
at length, the affair coming to the
prince&#8217;s ear, he ordered them to be
imprisoned for endeavouring to seduce
the people. When Jesus heard
of this, he sent another of his disciples,
generally supposed to have
been Simon Peter; who, coming to
Antioch, and appearing as a zealous
idolater, soon insinuated himself into
the favour of the inhabitants and of
their prince, and at length took an
opportunity to desire the prince would
order the two persons who, as he was
informed, had been put in prison for
broaching new opinions to be brought
before him to be examined; and accordingly
they were brought: when
Peter, having previously warned them
to take no notice that they knew him,
asked them who sent them; to which
they answered, God, who had created
all things and had no companion.
He then required some convincing
proof of their mission, upon which
they restored a blind person to his
sight and performed some other
miracles, with which Peter seemed
not to be satisfied, for that according
to some he did the very same miracles
himself, but declared that if
their God could enable them to raise
the dead he would believe them;
which condition the two apostles accepting,
a lad was brought who had
been dead seven days, and at their
prayers he was raised to life; and
thereupon Peter acknowledged himself
convinced, and ran and demolished
the idols, a great many of
the people following him and embracing
the true faith; but those who
believed not were destroyed by the
cry of the angel Gabriel.&mdash;S. (B., Z.,
&amp;c.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_340" id="Footnote_340"></a><a href="#FNanchor_340"><span class="label">[340]</span></a> Some say these two were John
and Paul; but others name different
persons.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_341" id="Footnote_341"></a><a href="#FNanchor_341"><span class="label">[341]</span></a> Simon Peter.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_342" id="Footnote_342"></a><a href="#FNanchor_342"><span class="label">[342]</span></a> His tomb is still shown near
Antioch, and is much visited by the
Mo&#7717;ammadans.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_343" id="Footnote_343"></a><a href="#FNanchor_343"><span class="label">[343]</span></a> Also some said he was taken up
into heaven; and others, that his
manhood only suffered, and that his
godhead ascended into heaven.&mdash;S.
(B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_344" id="Footnote_344"></a><a href="#FNanchor_344"><span class="label">[344]</span></a> Some, referring the relative <i>his</i>
to the first antecedent, take the
meaning to be that no Jew or Christian
shall die before he believes in
Jesus; for they say that when one
of either of those religions is ready to
breathe his last, and sees the angel of
death before him, he shall then believe
in that prophet as he ought,
though his faith will not then be of
any avail. According to a tradition
of El-Hajj&aacute;j, when a Jew is expiring
the angels will strike him on the
back and face, and say to him, &#8216;O
thou enemy of God, Jesus was sent
as a prophet unto thee, and thou
didst not believe on him;&#8217; to which
he will answer, &#8216;I now believe him
to be the servant of God:&#8217; and to
a dying Christian they will say,
&#8216;Jesus was sent as a prophet unto
thee, and thou hast imagined him to
be God, or the son of God;&#8217; whereupon
he will believe him to be the
servant of God only and His apostle.&mdash;Others,
taking the above-mentioned
relative to refer to Jesus, suppose the
intent of the passage to be that all
Jews and Christians in general [the
dead being raised to life in their
graves] shall have a right faith in
that prophet before his death, that
is, when he descends from heaven and
returns into the world, where he is
to kill Antichrist and to establish
the Mo&#7717;ammadan religion and a most
perfect tranquillity and security on
earth [where he will remain forty
years, and then die.&mdash;Others again
suppose that the words &#8216;believe in
him&#8217; signify &#8216;believe in God.&#8217;]&mdash;S.
(B., Z., Jel&aacute;l, &amp;c.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_345" id="Footnote_345"></a><a href="#FNanchor_345"><span class="label">[345]</span></a> It is a dispute among the
Mo&#7717;ammadans whether Christ actually
died or not before his assumption.&mdash;S.
(B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_346" id="Footnote_346"></a><a href="#FNanchor_346"><span class="label">[346]</span></a> Some, however, are of opinion
it [this passage] might have been revealed
in answer to certain idolaters,
who said that the Christians, who
received the Scriptures, worshipped
Jesus, supposing him to be the son of
God; whereas the angels were more
worthy of that honour than he.&mdash;S.
(B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_347" id="Footnote_347"></a><a href="#FNanchor_347"><span class="label">[347]</span></a> As easily as We produced Jesus
without a father [B.]. The intent of
the words is to show how just and
reasonable it is to think that the
angels should bear the relation of
children to men rather than to God,
they being His creatures as well as
men, and equally in His power.&mdash;S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_348" id="Footnote_348"></a><a href="#FNanchor_348"><span class="label">[348]</span></a> For some time before the resurrection
Jesus is to descend on earth
according to the Mo&#7717;ammadans near
Damascus, or as some say near a
rock [or rather a mountain-road]
named [&acute;A&#7731;abet] Afeek, with a lance
in his hand, wherewith he is to kill
Antichrist, whom he will encounter
at Ludd, or Lydda, a small town not
far from Joppa. They add that he
will arrive at Jerusalem at the time
of morning-prayer, that he shall perform
his devotions after the Mo&#7717;ammadan
institution, and officiate instead
of the Im&aacute;m, who shall give
place to him; that he will break
down the cross, and destroy the
churches of the Christians, of whom
he will also make a general slaughter,
excepting only such as shall profess
El-Isl&aacute;m.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_349" id="Footnote_349"></a><a href="#FNanchor_349"><span class="label">[349]</span></a> Either by rejecting and contemning Jesus, as the Jews do; or raising
him to an equality with God, as do
the Christians.&mdash;S. (B.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_350" id="Footnote_350"></a><a href="#FNanchor_350"><span class="label">[350]</span></a> For the Eastern writers mention
a sect of Christians which held the
Trinity to be composed of those three;
but it is allowed that this heresy has
been long since extinct.&mdash;S.</p></div>
